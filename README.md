# Arbitrum Data Ingestion Framework

## !IMPORTANT for Arb Bounty Reviews - I did a signifigant refactoring to the repo today to prepare for the next set of facts.
## ! Please refer to the state of the repository in this commit (https://github.com/jchanolm/arbitrum-data/commit/39d77fdfd4db2b8f97fc2fae9db74050e88cc39c) for the code at the time the ## !original set of tasks closed 

## Tl;dr 

This repo contains scripts for scraping on and off-chain data relevant for understanding the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Some examples: grant awardees and Github profiles, DAO proposals and voters, forum posts and posters...

The code is organized into two three modules:
- `scraping`: scripts to scrape data
- `ingestion` scripts to ingest data into a Neo4J, a graph database
- `post-processing` scripts to enrich data in Neo4J with additional attributes


## Design strategy
---- 
The repository structure allows you to call commands using a Python module approach. 
For example, run `python3 -m pipelines.scraping.discourse.scrape` 
to scrape posts and post authors from Arbitrum DAO's Discourse forum.

## Data

Data for each source (i.e. discourse, snapshot) is located in the `/data` subdirectory of each data source's scraper.

I.e. scraped Discourse data lives in `pipelines/scraping/discourse/data/`


## Install
---- 
Create a virtual environment using **Python 3.10. 
After that, install requirements w/ `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


## Docker Image
-----
Package the module into a Docker image for cloud deployment or local use. 
To build the image, run 
`docker build . -t arbitrum-pipelines`
 
Then, execute the modules directly through the Docker image 
by replacing "module", "service", and "action" with the desired pipeline module. 

I.e.  `docker run --env-file .env arbitrum-pipelines python3 -m pipelines.[module].[service].[action]`

Remember to have a `.env file` containing all the necessary environment variables. 
For your convenience, the repo also contains a `Docker Compose` file.
