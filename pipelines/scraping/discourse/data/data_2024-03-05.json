Event Horizon isn\u2019t a single delegate, nor even an institution, it\u2019s tooling. It\u2019s a protocol with automated structures already built and functioning to allow a large body of retail voters to collectively vote.

If you believe the optimal native voting power is $0, then we may not come to an agreement. If we can agree that each member of this community should have <em>some</em> voice then it becomes a discussion of quantity</p>\n<p>To your points:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>You can also, regardless of your financial capabilities, receive delegations from other users. Therefore, there is a way that does not involve delegation from the DAO itself.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While it\u2019s true that there is a way, that does not mean it is an efficient or the only way.  This also isn\u2019t an argument against a retail enfranchisement pool, both models can and should exist simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The model you point to is status quo and has proven limited. Hardly any lower capital users participate. Back of the envelope calculations from 10 recent Snapshots shows an average voter participation rate of 2%. We don\u2019t know what is optimal but it certainly isn\u2019t 2%. Delegation does nothing to raise this figure.</p>\n<p>We also have what we call \u2018Satoshi Wallet\u2019 delegations or delegations which have been placed long ago with an absent or inactive delegator. The wallet being delegated to is often inactive itself. This is complete entropy of governance potential. Through the EH model, delegation is mailable and 100% efficient/productive as EH votes 100% of the time.</p>\n<p>It also adds unnecessarily high barriers for our community to explore the ideas of the majority of its members who are currently sidelined due to no meaningful say. Most people (despite potentially having great ideas) won\u2019t contribute as they have no voice. Having to win a delegation popularity contest in order to have their ideas surfaced is sub-optimal. Delegation, while crucial, in practice isn\u2019t a meritocracy. Further, under the current system, someone with $1m and no talent can buy and start voting in a serious way. In fact, in today\u2019s model, <strong>even a single misaligned moderately wealthy agent poses a greater potential risk than the totality of all retail voters within the EH voter enfranchisement pool.</strong></p>\n<p>We see our retail enfranchisement public good voter pool as complementary to boosting individual underrepresented delegates. We\u2019re simultaneously calling for an elevation of small to medium sized delegates in a parallel proposal we workshopped at the Arbitrum GovHack hackathon posted <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-12-empowering-underrepresented-delegates/21533\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Could you see how the EH vote gives smaller sums to many retail voices vs large sums to specific delegates? We view this as a slight boost to the little voices, and our GovHack proposal as a moderate boost to the medium sized voters. Both aim at elevating voices at all stages of the delegate pipeline.</p>\n<p>Eg someone with $50 not voting at all today is encouraged to mint a free pass and start participating because they claim let\u2019s say $10,000 of voice through the public enfranchisement pool. Their votes and thoughts allow them to stand out and qualify for an under represented delegation of 1m arb as an individual later on. At present the first step to meaningfully participating is so high it functions as a wall, not a stair step. We need to add progressive growth opportunities to effectively allow stair stepped onboarding from community member to meaningful vote participant.

Many are eager to just have a voice (we\u2019re already seeing this).</p>\n<p>So, while those seeking capital may not resonate with this opportunity, that doesn\u2019t invalidate it for the many who are interested absent payment. In fact, those who are eager to have their voices heard <em>in spite of</em> not receiving capital, should be propped up.</p>\n<p>We\u2019d also argue those willing out of enthusiasm, not payment are some of the most ecosystem valuable. It also is significant to note that this adds participation directly, without inflationary rewards.

It can have a \u201cbad\u201d optic in some cases, but again is a case by case scenario depending on how the whole thing developed. No hard rule.

I think AF should be more explicit in term of what can and can\u2019t be done by protocols through multiple grant. This also, in my opinion, should also be just an indication. If an independent council is elected, as long as the council follows the rules in their election/proposal, can technically guarantee a grant to an entity even if this goes against the reccomendation of the AF. I also see this as quite unlikely.<br>\nBut, in general, we need an overall effort in term of creating rules for protocols applying in different grant programs, marketing in the sense of explaining what is out there as programs and what is the scope, and also general reccomendations from AF regarding multiple applications.</p>\n<p>Which again, to me, are possible, as long as we clarify the scope.</p>\n<p>For what it matters, a few times I evaluated with the project that them applying to questbook was not the best way, usually due to the size of max grant (25k), and so advised, and sometimes helped, creating a proposal directly for the AF, for the very same goals, while putting on pause the application in questbook. I have also killed a few cross application that were live both in questbook and in uniswap arbitrum grant program because they were a match, as well as applications that requested a grant for something already build through a grant from another chain.

We do not have specific advice on where the max maturity should be, other than \u201cless than a year\u201d allows a maximum of a year to get all the money back if selling on the market would create a loss.

If one performs poorly or violates terms, assets can be returned and routed to the other provider, preventing interruption of the program. From experience, it may also be that having two providers provides some assurance that money can be recalled in a timely manner even if one structure gets funds stuck due to a bank, brokerage, or manager error. We would recommend that the two providers not be carbon copies of each other \u2013 much of the value in having two providers would be lost if they both utilized the same banking and custodial partners.</p>", "author": "GFXlabs", "parent_post_title": "Final: Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program", "parent_post_id": 20139}, {"text": "<p>Thanks for your explanation!<br>\nHowever, I believe that the purpose/distribution of the resulting profits is the essence of this proposal.

The precise method of generating revenue from this arrangement remains unclear. Plutus is granting users rewards in the form of $PLS tokens to incentivize deposits. Once a user has contributed to a Plutus token, the conversion is permanent. The sole exit route involves selling the wrapped token on a DEX. These wrapped tokens, on average, are trading at less than 60 cents on the dollar.\u201d</p>\n<p>We are extremely clear and upfront about how plsAssets function in our docs. plsARB functions exactly the same as any other plsAsset. The ratio between an asset and a plsAsset varies, predominantly according to the user\u2019s collective demand for the yield of the underlying asset.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u201cWhen Arbitrum introduced its token, Plutus swiftly seized the opportunity. The network encountered difficulties handling the surge of users seeking to claim tokens simultaneously, prompting Plutus to establish its own external app page for users to claim through.\u201d</p>\n<p>We had an external app page setup for claiming prior to the airdrop that had been prepared for launch over the weeks leading up to the airdrop. It was not created as a reaction to the network surge. This page was created as a courtesy for Plutus users who were interested in converting to plsARB, as a reaction to the surge and people being unable to claim through Arbitrums native airdrop claim page our page was disseminated on Twitter.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u201cAdditionally, Plutus introduced its wrapped version of $ARB, namely $plsARB. Details about plsARB remain scarce, including how its value will accrue and how the Plutus team will utilize user voting power in governance, among other aspects.\u201d</p>\n<p>We have clearly stated in our Discord that we are preparing a proposal that will introduce native value accrual to the ARB token and thus directly benefit the entire Arbitrum ecosystem, plsARB and all ARB token holders. In addition, sequencer fee distribution has been long talked about as a potential value accrual mechanism for the ARB token, even being discussed before the token itself was released. We\u2019ve also made it abundantly clear that the voting power of all assets will be transferred to bPLS holders. Until then we will vote in the best interest of Plutus. Once bPLS governance goes live users will have the ability to put forth a proposal that disbands or changes the mechanics around plsARB.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u201cIn the course of the airdrop claiming process, Plutus enabled users to \u201cstake\u201d their ARB tokens for immediate conversion to plsARB. No warnings or disclaimers were provided about the irreversible nature of this process (although the site has been updated since, there are several screenshots captured during the original airdrop that prove it, I will allow the community to validate these claims too).\u201d</p>\n<p>Users had the option to only \u201cClaim\u201d their airdrop as well as the option to claim and convert to plsARB with ample disclaimers - with even more added after taking in initial feedback. These were two distinctly different functions as can be seen in the image below.

Or alternatively they can wait until the very end where they know exactly how their vote will affect the election.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll add, I also think this harms future council elections as results may not fully indicate a losing candidates true support.

Their dedication contributes significantly to the overall success and sustainability of the project they support.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/cp0x\">@cp0x</a></p>", "author": "Mysterymen", "parent_post_title": "[Non-Constitutional]: Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal 2.0", "parent_post_id": 20404}, {"text": "<p>Hi,<br>\nI in no way belittle your services to the community, however, I believe that any offers that provide drops or grants should be competitive.<br>\nWhat I mean:<br>\nIt seems to me that the proposal should look like this.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Criteria (as an example):\n<ul>\n<li>Wrote 100 messages on the forum</li>\n<li>Wrote 50 posts on Twitter.</li>\n<li>Made a proposal and it was accepted in Tally.</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After this, we accept applications from users for a month, providing evidence of fulfillment of the above conditions.</li>\n<li>A DAO committee then reviews these applications and identifies specific users who meet the criteria.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this case, it is a fair offer in which anyone who considers himself an early adopter can participate</p>\n<p>But in the proposal presented there is a limited circle of people who have agreed among themselves, which I consider unfair towards others.</p>", "author": "cp0x", "parent_post_title": "[Non-Constitutional]: Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal 2.0", "parent_post_id": 20404}, {"text": "<p>Hi, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/cp0x\">@cp0x</a> Thank you for your communication.

The 25 arbiters come from all over the world and have different environments and backgrounds. It was extremely difficult to get the arbiter together again.</p>\n<p>From the current status quo, Arbiter no longer has the ability to establish an evaluation system or framework that can include all early contributors to Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><strong>In summary, the proposal\u2019s retroactive membership scope is only the 25 arbiters recognized by Arbitrum team members.

In my opinion (and given previous experience forming part of departments where procurement processes were at play, albeit at a governmental level), a team of 3 qualified persons can get this done. The Subsidy-Fund + Means Test need quite a bit of RnD as this is an industry-first for DAOs. In my opinion, the above justifies a team of 3. In addition, most procurement committees are actually made up of 3 or 5 people (odd number in case there are internal decisions that need to be taken so that it doesn\u2019t result in a stalemate). In my opinion, the work enlisted in the mandate would not justify a team of 5 skilled persons, but can easily be executed by a 3-person team during a 6-month period.</p>\n<p>Feel free to reach out to me on Telegram should you have any additional queries <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/immutablelawyer\">@immutablelawyer</a> - thanks for your queries sir!</p>", "author": "Immutablelawyer", "parent_post_title": "Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee", "parent_post_id": 20064}, {"text": "<p>Thanks for the feedback <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/jengajojo\">@jengajojo</a> !</p>\n<p>This is a consideration that was being debated i.e. having a max term limit.

The members will be DAOAdvocate, Risk, Security, Research. The seats can be taken up jointly by applicants via a joint application.</p>\n<p>Procurement Committee: The ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee is completely different from the ARDC. It aspires to facilitate ratified frameworks, substantiate ratified frameworks with guidances notes &amp; circulars, establish a subsidy fund for security services, establish a means test for project subsidy eligibility &amp; create other frameworks for different verticals (not an exclusive right). The intention is to create a marketplace for reputable service providers within the industry for multiple verticals so that projects within the Ecosystem have ease of access to reputable &amp; whitelisted service providers.</p>\n<p>The dual TL;DR aside, I will now delve into your queries below:</p>\n<p><strong>\u2018One Committee for All Verticals\u2019</strong></p>\n<p>This will not be \u2018one committee for all verticals\u2019. Throughout various calls we\u2019ve had in recent weeks (even on ArbitrumDAO day), we continuously voiced our intention that the ideal way forward is to have various committees for the different verticals in relation to which procurement frameworks are ratified. We have already started discussing ways of achieving this from an internal operational pov such as using Hats Protocol (who we already discussed with), to create a procurement structure for the ArbitrumDAO in the coming year &amp; years for the different verticals and have subject-matter expert members for these verticals.</p>\n<p>Additionally, also keep in mind that the Committee will naturally prioritise the verticals that are needed (refer to the \u2018Needs Assessment\u2019 step).</p>\n<p><strong>\u2018Overlapping Proposals or Lack of Framework Clarity\u2019</strong></p>\n<p>There is actually no overlap between the ADPC &amp; the ARDC (Refer to the TL;DR above). The ARDC is not tasked with developing frameworks (here, you are incorrect), but (as you quoted) with \u2018Governance Optimization\u2019 through research &amp; development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s governance framework\u2019. The ARDC has no involvement whatsoever in the procurement arm of the ArbitrumDAO (or ancillary matters) as its mandate is tied to the ArbitrumDAO Governance Framework (the ArbitrumDAO governance framework is not a procurement framework).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"conflicting-interests-raise-questions-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#conflicting-interests-raise-questions-1\"></a>\u2018Conflicting interests raise questions\u2019</h3>\n<p>For the first part, I think this is addressed via the above. The ARDC is not responsible for creating any frameworks (this is nowhere in the ARDC proposal).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How would be the relationship with the members of the Collective, if the Procurement Committee will create a whitelisted marketplace of service providers?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Procurement Committee has no relationship with members of the Collective.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the Committee of this proposal will be responsible for creating all the procurement frameworks and support material, why is the <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xf49d88ec2f4fa7373efc66a7cf9441d916519f48a2d90e7db3ea688357150a44\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Collective</a> needed in its current form?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As explained above, the ARDC mandate is separate, distinct &amp; unique from the mandate of the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee. Hence, both are actually needed to cater for their respective areas as highlighted by their respective mandate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is it in the best interest of the DAO to have a Collective helping to shape/draft proposals and a Committee creating frameworks for procurement proposals?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I\u2019ll answer this question with another set of questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Is it in the best interests of the DAO to have an arm of the DAO with elected members by the DAO itself serve as help to proposers should they require help with their proposals so as to cater for all the different corners their proposal has to tackle? I think yes (especially since these corners, if missing, would potentially make or break a proposal which, in its ideation, would be a value-add - we\u2019ve seen time and time again where ideas are optimal, with execution thereof being the sub-set thereof).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is it in the best interests of the DAO to have a marketplace of quality assured service providers for existing &amp; (especially) newer projects building or intending to build on Arbitrum?

The BEST. These are organizations like the Red Cross which has 100 years of learning. Their staff is administrative, not innovative.</p>\n<p>Our first milestone fee annualized is 672k ARB. There were multiple roles we needed but couldn\u2019t afford to hire. The team I poached is passionate, but they had to take cuts from previous roles. We did this in part because we realized we would need to show our value for the DAO to pay what we are worth. We took the bet on ourselves and on Arbitrum delegates to allow us to show our value and right size after milestone 1.</p>\n<p>Another consideration is thinking about our intention to execute and leave the DAO. There is no exit built in. We need to find a balance between what a fair payment is and what our margin is. Take a look at any other DAO with a grants program this size and you will see we are WELL below the standard.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"the-value-we-save-create-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#the-value-we-save-create-4\"></a>The Value We Save &amp; Create</h4>\n<p>Take the work we have done around STIP which will impact LTIPP and the ongoing program.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We offered a firestarter to Tnorm to drive the process of getting STIP formed and approved. This made sure the program could happen.</li>\n<li>We funded Open Block Labs for data monitoring services. This provides the data for us to learn for future programs (and potentially shut off misbehavior).</li>\n<li>We funded Open Source Observer to provide data for optimization using github and onchain forensics</li>\n<li>We funded Helika Gaming to index &amp; analyze onchain behaviors and use gaming derived analytic models to identify and define engagement or \u201cstickiness\u201d</li>\n<li>We funded Karma &amp; Thank ARB to incentivize community-led reviews to continually assess the impact of every grant funded</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will likely see over $100 million in incentives given in 2024. If you think our work will have saved even 5% in efficiency through these grants, then our fee has paid for itself.</p>\n<p>This is ONLY ONE example of many ways we have and will have created value for Arbitrum.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"volitility-almost-crushed-our-first-milestone-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#volitility-almost-crushed-our-first-milestone-5\"></a>Volitility Almost Crushed our First Milestone</h4>\n<p>Our 336k ARB for the first milestone went down from 1.16 to around $0.80 for half of our milestone time. Had we not been delayed by compliance issues, we would have paid out when the price was down. Had that happened, our team would have been out of funds to pay a team of four at the end of December.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-happens-if-you-dont-spend-all-the-funds-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-happens-if-you-dont-spend-all-the-funds-6\"></a>What happens if you don\u2019t spend all the funds?</h1>\n<p><em><strong>This is an important point, this vote doesn\u2019t send the allocation fund to Plurality Labs team! All the funds are sent to the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig which is run by a majority of delegates.</strong></em> Our fee is then sent to our multisig from there. If there is leftover, we will simply roll it forward. There is no way for us to keep it. A good thing about the funds still being controlled by the DAO is that we don\u2019t need to nitpick at how much is being rolled forward because it is all the DAOs funds.</p>\n<p>In terms of the fee, we could right size it with the next budget. Say we allocated 80% of the total, we could calculate 20% of our fee and take it out of our third milestone fee. I totally understand that there is a slight incentive for our team to want to allocate everything, even if we do it poorly. That is a legitimate risk, but I\u2019m committing to not doing that.</p>\n<p>Our team\u2019s interest in solving this problem without an exit package is that we know solving the problems and bringing success to Arbitrum will open a wide tapestry of lucrative offers in the future. We don\u2019t get that if we aren\u2019t genuine in how we handle disputes and conflict that naturally arises. Hopefully you can understand our position and see how our best interest is aligned with Arbitrum.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"why-30-million-arb-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#why-30-million-arb-7\"></a>Why 30 million ARB?</h1>\n<p>We stated the goal of massively scaling what the DAO can safely allocate in our first milestone proposal. In an early comment about that statement, we clarified it meant going from 3 million ARB in Milestone 1 to 30 million in Milestone 2 to 100 million in Milestone 3. While these numbers were just randomly pulled out of thin air, there is some logic to it.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Other ecosystems are spending hundreds of millions attracting builders.</strong></em> How much did Optimism drop yesterday? That was the second one this year, correct? How about Polygon\u2019s 200 million? Avalanche? Near? Solana? I think you get the point.</p>\n<p>How are we going to keep up???</p>\n<p>Also consider that Optimism\u2019s foundation has like 35% of the token supply. Our foundation has 7.5% (and they got dragged for taking that much!) We then collectively forced them to put their funds into a vesting schedule! (I was in support of this at the time, but now I realize it was a mistake.)</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t have anyone capable of making big bets for our ecosystem. Let\u2019s free up some funds for Plurality Labs to try and make some big bets as approved by the oversight delegates! We are very willing to work on what checks and balances are in place to ensure quality.

Waiting for the formalization of a framework (or several) and not acting will make it impossible for Arbitrum to meaningfully compete with other ecosystems who are able to move much more swiftly (whether by more centralized design, stage/maturity, culture, etc.). The establishment of any framework also shouldn\u2019t be seen as a silver bullet as everything will be based on its execution at the end of the day \u2014 this in itself will take even more time (design, funding, diligence, negotiation, etc.). Despite the significant resources that Arbitrum DAO has access to, the massive advantage that the ecosystem isn\u2019t being tapped into. Pragmatically speaking, bets will need to be made to allow the ecosystem to seize the advantage sitting in our collective laps and continue moving forward, even if mistakes may be made along the way. Marks will be missed and resources will probably be misallocated from time to time but making fast moves while quickly validating / course correcting will be better than opting and waiting for perfection.</p>\n<p><strong>RE: Treasure\u2019s position</strong><br>\nWith Treasure being a DAO with its own lofty mission/goals and a small core contributor team striving to coordinate what is arguably one of the largest communities on Arbitrum with a complex set of stakeholders (game studios, players, other builders and contributors)\u2026 all of this is already a difficult, Herculean task.

I think this would be a substantial single point of failure + risk that should be avoided. This is why it\u2019s more optimal to have a DAOAdvocate being a subject-matter expert re.

The model you\u2019re describing above is basically the Grants Program model i.e. Service Providers apply to work on a project on a project-by-project basis.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is not as efficient or as optimal as having a retainer-style approach that the ARDC is implementing as per the proposal above. In addition, I personally (emphasis on personally as these are just my thoughts), would not agree that the mandate is too wide or that this would cause a systematic risk for the reasons enlisted hereunder:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The mandate is restricted to the following; Proposal Review &amp; Assistance (where proposers would request assistance), Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates (this helps ensure that code updates are not malicious+are accurate), Quantitative Analysis &amp; identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In addition, there is no systematic risk present (happy to hear your thoughts re. where a systematic risk may arise though). The ARDC is not a decision-making body &amp; cannot influence decisions (if anything, it can aid delegates in effecting better decisions due to its mandate; specifically, the objective reporting re. proposed initiatives + proposal optimisations where the proposer requests assistance). A systematic risk would have been present if the ARDC would have been given decision-making authority re. what proposals get to be posted/what proposals go to the voting phase (however, this is not the case).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Also, this proposal does not make the ARDC a \u2018default gatekeeper of the DAO\u2019. The ARDC cannot gatekeep proposals, cannot decide on which proposals go to the voting stage, is bound by legally enforceable checks &amp; balances, gives legally enforceable rights to the DAOAdvocate (refer to the DAOAdvocate section) &amp; much more. The ARDC is positioned as a collective aimed at aiding the ArbitrumDAO where needed, and cannot (it literally cannot), gatekeep in any way, shape or form as it does not have the rights (legal or otherwise) to do so given that it does not have decision-making powers over ANY facets of the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ARDC cannot preclude any community member such as myself for ex. from submitting a proposal, going to Snapshot etc. If anything, I can get funded for working on a particular endeavour, and also request the ARDC\u2019s help in the structuring of that endeavour should I encounter any obstacles that would need their subject-matter expertise.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In conclusion, I respectfully disagree with your concerns regarding the proposal\u2019s potential systemic risk or \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 role. Furthermore, I wish to clarify that the broad powers mentioned in your final sentence are, in fact, non-existent. The ARDC\u2019s scope is limited to providing services related to proposal review, assistance, research, and optimization, in accordance with its Mandate.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your input &amp; I look forward to your participation at the voting stage whatever the vote may be!</p>", "author": "Immutablelawyer", "parent_post_title": "Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the 'Arbitrum Research & Development Collective'", "parent_post_id": 19899}, {"text": "<p>Hey <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/thedevanshmehta\">@thedevanshmehta</a> !</p>\n<p>I will have to respectfully disagree for reasons I shall cite below - naturally I\u2019d nonetheless like to thank you for contributing in relation to this proposal sir - it\u2019s been good to clarify a lot of points through these comments that could be shared by others <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/handshake.png?v=12\" title=\":handshake:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":handshake:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p><strong>Re. \u201cthe creation of an executive body\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Firstly, an executive branch of government is a body that carries out pivotal functions in relation to the actual application of laws and regulation within a particular jurisdiction. This is not what the ARDC\u2019s mandate reflects re. proposals. If anything, the ARDC is structured as being the executive\u2019s (ASrbitrumDAO), secretary, that assists the DAO in optimising proposal where there is the need for optimisation, creates objective reports to lessen the workload on the delegate side, and conducts preemeptive risk assessment re. code updates. Again, if anything, the ARDC is the executive\u2019s personal assistant, as opposed to being the executive itself (which it is not, and cannot be, due to the mandate - this is a substantial misconception that even Griff had).</p>\n<p><strong>Re. \u201cthe flywheel concern\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t at all applicable &amp; is quite a farreaching hypothesis. The same can be said to service providers applying for grants no? [revenue - hire staff - delegate duties etc.). If anything, service providers being part of the ARDC will hinder their prospects of being delegates, as they would not be able to influence proposals whatsoever given their seat within the ARDC &amp; have to omit from voicing concerns on proposals, and stick to reporting objectively on them. Hence, this as well, cannot materialise.</p>\n<p><strong>Re. \u201cexplicitly encourage something as divisional as a coalition\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>I unfortunately fail to see how a research &amp; development collective aimed at helping out proposers optimise &amp; refine proposals so as to provide a better result to the ArbitrumDAO is divisional in any way shape or form. Unfortunately, I think a lot have a prejudiced view of seeing a group of persons that are being paid (below industry-rate mind you, as all the caps are all below industry rate), for providing substantial value to an Ecosystem that needs it. Emphasis on needs it.</p>\n<p><strong>A comment from my end:</strong></p>\n<p>I keep seeing the term service provider being thrown around; nowhere in the proposal is it stated that this is gated to service providers in the industry - in fact, certain prominent delegates themselves have reached out to express interest in participating albeit not being service providers, but having expertise in certain areas. Keep in mind, you will be voting on who gets elected - if you do not want a prominent SP to take a seat but want a core contributor that is as proficient in an area, you have all the liberty to express interest for that contributor. This isn\u2019t gated and there is an open-door policy for participation.</p>\n<p>All in all, thanks a lot for the feedback, albeit not agreeing with your concerns I do appreciate you taking the time to voice these concerns especially since, potentially, they could be shared by other members.</p>\n<p>Thanks !</p>", "author": "Immutablelawyer", "parent_post_title": "Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the 'Arbitrum Research & Development Collective'", "parent_post_id": 19899}, {"text": "<p>Hey <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/bubli.eth\">@bubli.eth</a> ,</p>\n<p>The proposal contains several legally enforceable checks &amp; balances together with several powers attributed to the DAOAdvocate (the only member seat that has legally enforceable powers), re. the regulation of the ARDC (Refer to sections on checks and balances, provisions, operational parameters etc.)</p>", "author": "Immutablelawyer", "parent_post_title": "Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the 'Arbitrum Research & Development Collective'", "parent_post_id": 19899}, {"text": "<p>Thanks for your comment <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/danielo\">@danielo</a> !</p>\n<p>In my opinion, the RnDAO engagement\u2019s scope is actually much wider than the ARDC scope.

It is important to recognize that this framework is experimental and far from perfect. However, starting with a baseline is essential, evaluating the results over a given period, and then making adjustments for improvement. We are aware of the difficulty in achieving a fair balance, but we are confident that, over time, we will be able to establish the right incentives.</p>\n<p>Regarding your comment on the high entry participation rate and its possible impact on reducing the number of participating delegates, we agree with what you mentioned. We propose to modify the following parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All-time participation rate - Tally: +50%, taking into account votes from a 4-month period (current rate is +70% considering votes from day 0).</li>\n<li>Total Participation (Total Participation - TP): + 50% this parameter determines which delegates enter the top 10 (Currently set to +70%)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, we are considering the possibility of increasing the number of selected delegates from 10 to 15 per level. However, this would also imply requesting a larger budget, on which we do not yet have a final decision. We would like to receive feedback from other delegates in this regard.</p>\n<p>Regarding compensation for proactivity and initiative, we completely agree with you. It is a challenge to distinguish actions that benefit the DAO and avoid incentivizing initiatives that only favor a small group or the delegates themselves. For this reason, we have included in the proposal a bonus point system (+25% in participation points - TP), aimed at rewarding those delegates who contribute with initiatives beneficial to the DAO. Initially, these bonus points will be awarded by the program administrator.

These points will initially be allocated by the program administrator, but we do think we need at least some sort of rubric that the administrator could use to determine how many bonus points a delegate should receive for specific actions.</p>\n<p>Our original intention was to encourage delegates to be more proactive, and ideally compensate those who manage to push proposals like the following to snapshot with bonus points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposals related to governance processes and templates.

We seek additional feedback on this aspect.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"incentive-system-administrator-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#incentive-system-administrator-6\"></a>Incentive System Administrator</h3>\n<p>In the current context, the Arbitrum Foundation has two Facilitators. However, we are aware that we cannot assign additional responsibilities to them as DAOs. The initial uncertainty about the magnitude of the workload to administer this system has been clarified thanks to the feedback provided by Patrick. Consequently, we consider it pertinent to seek the collaboration of another person, delegate or entity, who, in conjunction with SEEDLatam, will contribute to the effective implementation of the program.</p>\n<p>We are willing to allocate a specific budget for this collaboration, but we wish to confirm if this proposal has the governance endorsement. We also want to emphasize that we offered to administer this program from SEED Latam in case we don\u2019t find a facilitator willing to run it ~ and if this happens our delegation would obviously not partake in the program, regardless we do understand the concerns raised plus potential conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>This approach highlights the relevance of roles such as facilitator. Previously, we proposed an RFC to discuss the integration of the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-3-introduction-of-a-new-role-in-governance-governance-facilitator/15716\">Facilitator role in the DAO</a>. At that time, the activity and initiatives were not as significant as they are today, which is why we did not move forward with the proposal.

Among the other changes, I think it is in a good state for voting.</p>\n<p>I saw the discussion regarding snapshot. I think something to add is that the Scoring System does include Tally Votes, so though it is not part of the historical Participation Rate metric, it still is reflected in 15% of the weighting. So while Tally has more weight overall, voting on Snapshot has not lost impact completely. If there is large pushback to include the Snapshot metrics, my suggestion would be just ignoring the any votes related to the Round 1 STIP. I know that isn\u2019t a great solution, but the large vote count massively throws off Snapshot metrics to the point I\u2019m not sure it accurately reflects the spirit of a historical participation rate. i.e., someone who voted only in the STIP will have a far better participant rate then someone who voted in everything but the STIP. And beyond even all that, makes tracking a nightmare. While not perfect, it may be a worthwhile compromise.

Whilst this isn\u2019t inherently a bad thing, it makes one wonder how Suhsi has shown its commitment to Arbitrum so far? From what I have seen, Sushi is more actively pursuing Base and a multitude of other chains, hence my lack of confidence that Sushi is the best placed protocol to serve solely the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sushi has a long standing history of supporting networks at their earliest stages. We were the very first DEX to launch on Arbitrum, all the way back in block 70 (<a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x8d0a67317d0f3996ce544776afa7c503e8c33d0475a0660e08748d1a8cad14a5\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Arbiscan</a>). In addition, our presence as a cross-chain protocol has benefited Arbitrum greatly due to our cross-chain swapping capabilities. More than one-third of our cross-chain swap volume is made up of users going from an origin chain to Arbitrum. This cross-chain swap feature was actually one of the very first bridges that was put in place on the network, which greatly contributed to Arbitrum\u2019s early growth by allowing users to seamlessly enter into the ecosystem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>I do not wish to criticise Sushi as a protocol, but objectively speaking there are several DEXs on Arbitrum that have higher efficiency, more ecosystem focus, better offerings etc. These DEXs have made significantly more progress in establishing deep liquidity for $ARB, whilst Sushi is amongst one of the lowest actively used venues for $ARB trading. What makes Sushi the best placed DEX to do this? Looking at objective metrics would place Sushi relatively low in the ranking of DEXs. Sushi\u2019s current volume for $ARB is almost non-existent compared to Uniswap.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your opinion here is appreciated! Before getting to your question it\u2019s important to note that there are multiple ways to interpret \u201chigher efficiency\u201d and \u201cbetter offerings,\u201d so we\u2019ve done our best to answer accordingly. We would love to understand more specifically what you are referring to.</p>\n<p>With that said, we encourage examining historic volume, TVL, etc. and it will become quickly apparent that up until fairly recently, Sushi was the second-highest volume DEX on Arbitrum. However, to answer your specific question about what makes Sushi the best place to do this,there are several factors that come into play.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As one of the oldest DEXs in Web3, we have a large and loyal user base. Earlier, you mentioned that we are a cross-chain protocol, and we have built our infrastructure in such a way that we are able to seamlessly bring our community from the multiple networks we are available on over to Arbitrum. Our xSwap feature is currently available on seven chains, but in the near future, v2 will be released and 30+ networks will be added, making Sushi the perfect home for deep $ARB liquidity as users from those networks gain access to the xSwap feature</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In other words, having a central liquidity hub that is inherently multi- and cross-chain directly feeds the Arbitrum network and its liquidity providers.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Sushi\u2019s recent drop in liquidity on Arbitrum can be easily attributed to mercenary liquidity miners taking their LPs to other protocols that are early on in their distribution curves. This actually strengthens the need for this proposal rather than weakens it. $ARB\u2019s on-chain liquidity profile is currently beholden to the whims of mercenary liquidity providers, as opposed to being steadfast with a permanent liquidity foundation owned by the DAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sushi still commands a significant liquidity presence on ETH mainnet, which is Arbitrum\u2019s greatest conduit for scale and trading activity. Having dedicated liquidity pools for settlement at the protocol level on Sushi, coupled with the xSwap v2 product (and aforementioned metrics), makes a significant case for deploying on us.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We would argue that it is better to have composability and interconnectivity with other ecosystems, especially as an EVM compatible L2 of ETH, interconnectedness to the ecosystem at large is part of the purpose of the chain. We believe that the entire industry is moving towards that thesis, and are attempting to usher others along in that direction.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>This proposal grossly overestimates the need for $ARB liquidity. Please can you clarify the sources for the data that justify this rather huge amount of $ARB from the treasury?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Uniswap itself has significant liquidity depth for Arbitrum, and when taking into all of the other sources of liquidity on the chain it is more than sufficient.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>This proposal also does not take into account the CEX liquidity profile, in which $ARB has multiple professional market makers.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To answer this question we\u2019d point back at the \u201cMotivation\u201d section of the proposal. There we explain that the price of $ARB has dropped by 33% since June of 2023, but the on-chain liquidity has dropped by 80%. If the only factor at play was the drop in price, the liquidity would have decreased by a smaller amount due to impermanent loss softening the depreciation. However, seeing as how the liquidity has decreased by more than twice the percentage of the decrease in price, it is clear that liquidity providers are taking their capital elsewhere. This proposal would remove the need for these mercenary liquidity providers in the first place by replacing them with liquidity that is owned by the DAO itself.</p>\n<p>To address the comment on CEX liquidity - we do take into account the fact that there is CEX liquidity for the token, It can be a great way to bring traditional finance and institutional investors into the space, and therefore does provide value. That being said, similar to you, we also believe in decentralization, so running a decentralized blockchain backed entirely by centralized liquidity would be counterintuitive. As we have stated in the proposal, $ARB has lost 80% of its decentralized liquidity in the last three and a half months. Most of the liquidity that there is for the token is not owned by the DAO, and can be removed by mercenary miners at any time. We look to offer a solution for Arbitrum to replace that liquidity in an efficient way, while diversifying the treasury into yield-bearing assets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Please could you explain what the optimal amount of onchain $ARB liquidity is? As mentioned above, per my own calculations, there is already sufficient liquidity on the chain (even in a market that has a lack of liquidity in general).</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For our estimates, please refer to the end of the background section. We would love to see your estimates and calculations on liquidity if you can share.</p>\n<p>As for Sushi, we came to our conclusion through extensive market research comparing tens of thousands of tokens to normalize a score for metrics such as market capitalization, total liquidity, owned liquidity, decentralized and CEX liquidity, emissions, time on main net, network, etc. This was done in order to better estimate the amount of liquidity that we expect each protocol should have. I agree with you that liquidity in the market is lacking. We believe that right now, this is the best solution to this market wide problem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Taking a 5% success fee is incredibly high considering that Sushi would be getting \u201cfree liquidity\u201d from the DAO, in which it would earn even further fees. If anything, Sushi should be paying considerable sums to the DAO in order to acquire such a large amount of ARB tokens, even if treated as a loan.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The liquidity being built will be owned by the Arbitrum DAO, and the LP fees will be collected by them. It is important to note that Sushi does not own this liquidity, nor does the user providing it, once they have purchased a bond. With Arbitrum as the LP provider, 83.3% of the fees go directly back to the Arbitrum foundation.</p>\n<p>Also, it is important to mention that these fees are only collected upon the successful sale of each bond. In other words, if no users end up buying a bond, we do not collect any fees, and no $ARB tokens enter into circulation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Your criticism of traditional liquidity incentives is incorrect and hyperbolic - to call it a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d is far from fair. By using PoL, you are not necessarily attracting new users, new builders, or any further ecosystem growth; you are simply promising deeper liquidity for $ARB itself. This in turn does not necessarily result in further value generated for the ecosystem. On the other hand, incentives have a proven track record of distributing the token which increases decentralisation and growth.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We really appreciate your summary of liquidity mining, as we believe it is a reflection of the lens through which many users view liquidity mining. Liquidity mining was created to offer protocols a way to deepen their liquidity without needing to supply lots of blue-chips and stablecoins directly, as they are very expensive. If the only metrics that you are looking at are distribution and decentralization, the best thing that you could do is airdrop tokens into as many wallets as possible. The issue with that is it would completely ignore many other factors, most notably, inflation.</p>\n<p>The more tokens that are given away to users for free, the more sell pressure this puts on the rest of the tokens and drags down the price. This is the reason we look at metrics like return on emissions (ROE) when discussing emitting tokens. Each token emitted should bring tangible value back to the ecosystem. Deeper liquidity for $ARB, stablecoins, and blue-chips means that there are more efficient trading routes for anyone on the network. This means a better trading experience for users, as they\u2019ll suffer less from slippage and price impact. This method also does a great job of distributing tokens, which in this case are vested to users. However, unlike liquidity mining, these are not the same handful of \u201cmercenary miners\u201d quickly migrating their liquidity positions to the next best opportunity.</p>\n<p>In addition, the term \u201cdeath spiral\u201d was originally coined by Messari - a leading research firm in web3. We take a data driven approach to everything we do and have therefore been monitoring the efficacy of liquidity mining since we invented it in 2020. Truth be told, it is a brilliant tool for bootstrapping liquidity, but it is incredibly inefficient at capturing any long-term value for the protocols that participate in it.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9fc17cc76df7cd2a9c4eb981e67649af001b7c30.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/mNgsGyfjvKRzpYUut8AUdCKAKC4.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/9fc17cc76df7cd2a9c4eb981e67649af001b7c30_2_624x351.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"mNgsGyfjvKRzpYUut8AUdCKAKC4\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/9fc17cc76df7cd2a9c4eb981e67649af001b7c30_2_624x351.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9fc17cc76df7cd2a9c4eb981e67649af001b7c30.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9fc17cc76df7cd2a9c4eb981e67649af001b7c30.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EBEEF1\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\"></span><span class=\"informations\">800\u00d7450 123 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Furthermore, bonding has a higher probability of helping with user acquisition than traditional liquidity mining. Bonds are purchased throughout the whole duration of the sales period, whereas with traditional liquidity mining the majority of the LPs will be added at the beginning of the farm, and then removed as soon as the farm is over.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Have you actively been engaged with the ecosystem governance? This proposal coincides with the current \u201cShort term incentive framework\u201d. From what I understand, Sushi has not actively been involved with Arbitrum governance thus far.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In preparation for this proposal, we have spent several months studying the $ARB token, the overall Arbitrum ecosystem, and as the market as a whole in order to figure out how to best support the goals and needs of the DAO. We are very confident that the plan we have put forward, including its built-in safeguards, is the perfect vehicle to help the Arbitrum DAO in its continued evolution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Please could you confirm what Sushi has done with the $ARB airdrop it received? From what I recall you received over 4,000,000 tokens.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We have held it securely and plan to be an active participant in governance going forward.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>Would Sushi be willing to use its ARB airdrop to prove a pilot of this proposal? Even if the community/DAO supported such a proposal, agreeing to hand over such a large amount of tokens should not take place without the necessary checks in place. I would like to see Sushi show commitment to the DAO and use its ARB to prove the efficacy of this programme before making a formal proposal.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no need to use our airdrop, because there is little to no risk for the DAO in this proposal. The allocation will be tranched out, with performance milestone KPIs built in to monitor and safeguard the tokens, and no tokens enter circulation if there are no bond sales. Additionally, that wouldn\u2019t solve the large challenge brought forth in this proposal, which is that Arbitrum would again be counting on third parties for its liquidity strength.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we plan to use our airdrop to participate in governance, as mentioned above.</p>", "author": "Sushi", "parent_post_title": "Proposal: Transforming Arbitrum's Financial Ecosystem \u2013 Enhancing Sustainable Growth and Innovation through SushiSwap\u2019s Bond Program", "parent_post_id": 16456}, {"text": "<p>Hey Kingofsparkles, thank you for the response!</p>\n<p>We see that you are a big fan of Arbitrum and are looking for new ways to boost growth, therefore we believe that when you understand the intentions behind our proposal you will be a big fan of it as well!<br>\nLet me start by addressing your key points.</p>\n<p>As the second longest standing DEX in general, and the first to launch on Arbitrum, we clearly have a vested interest in the liquidity on the chain. We have seen many new blockchains gain lots of hype and liquidity, only to lose the majority of both thanks to short term liquidity mining programs. We are true believers in DeFi and plan to continue to offer proven innovation methods to great blockchains like Arbitrum to ensure that they can retain their hype and liquidity in the future. As you have noted, The DEXes on Arbitrum have been losing large amounts of liquidity lately as their incentive tokens have been hit hard by the inflation from the emissions used to source it. This is an issue that we understand very intimately as we have suffered similarly in the past with the same liquidity mining programs. This is why we are so excited to have a solution for the future!</p>\n<p>Why the urgency behind this proposal?<br>\n1 As stated in \u201cbackground\u201d, the $ARB token has lost 80% of it\u2019s liquidity on chain in less than 4 months<br>\n2 Bonding, unlike liquidity mining, does not attract huge amounts of temporary liquidity instantly. Bonding is a solution meant to slowly build up liquidity over time. While we are confident that we can achieve a healthy amount of liquidity, the sooner the program is started, the more quickly this liquidity foundation can be built.</p>\n<p>Can we run a test of this proposal to see its effectiveness?<br>\nYes, that is the exact purpose of this proposal and the reason that we have broken it up into 4 quarters with its future only guaranteed by success.  Because bonds do not emit tokens if there is no demand, if the program does not work it will cost the DAO nothing as tokens that are not sold will be returned to the treasury.</p>\n<p>Kingofsparkles, I assure you that we believe that this proposal is the best possible thing for this ecosystem right now.

We mirror the urgency that you are feeling and hope that we can implement our solution soon!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>No comments on how they intend to manage the POL</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The management of the POL will ultimately rest with the Arbitrum DAO. It has the authority to decide on its utilization. Whether the DAO opts for active management of the POL, reallocating it to different DEXs, or pursuing any other strategy, the discretion lies with the DAO as the liquidity owner.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>No details about using v2 or v3</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To optimize the clawback rate, we will initially build liquidity following the v2 model. However, we are actively collaborating with Steer Protocol on v3 liquidity management. In the future, we intend to propose having Steer manage a portion of this liquidity to maximize efficiency. We also encourage other v3 management protocols to explore similar proposals once the POL is established.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The 5% success fee seems wholly unreasonable to my mind, I do not remember other proposals asking for such a fee</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thank you for this feedback. We believe that there may be some misinterpretation on how this fee works. Sushi makes nothing if this program is not successful. This is a great alignment of incentives between Sushi and Arbitrum.<br>\nAlso, based on what we have seen on other proposals, our fee is extremely modest. With Traditional liquidity mining, the \u201cfee\u201d associated can be viewed as 100% of the tokens used. What this means is that with these proposals, 0 tokens or liquidity will be returned to the DAO treasury. With that, we believe compared to the 100% fee on other proposals, our 5% is extremely modest.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Sushi has not been involved in Arbi governance thus far, as far as I am aware, so seems a bit overzealous to be asking for so much with a fee to boot. Feels like Sushi trying to stay relevant on Arbitrum but indeed with not much to back it up</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We believe that if you do not have anything of value to add to a discussion, it is not wise to say anything at all. We have focused our attention on our presence on-chain, launching on block 70 as the first DEX on arbitrum, complemented with our cross-chain xSwap, bringing thousands of users to the chain from others. We have used our time to build our DEX infrastructure and analyze the $ARB token so that we could be prepared to propose a sustainable solution to truly benefit the ecosystem.<br>\nIn regards to the size of the ask, at first glance it may seem like a lot of tokens. When you dig in though you will see that the large amount of tokens reflects the large amount of liquidity needed. Additionally, because of the nature of the bonds, if there is no demand, it will not cost ANY tokens meaning that this poses little to no risk to the ecosystem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>I remember quite well the vampire attack that set Sushi up, it was not a good look and deserves no credit to my mind, not the kind of history we want to see. Maybe I am not seeing it correctly, so would appreciate some clarity on what others think about that</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We acknowledge your perspective but believe that competition is beneficial. It challenges the status quo and, in our case, created a model for liquidity sourcing that has been emulated by countless protocols.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Sushiswap is on so many different chains and nowhere near as Arbitrum centric as other Arbitrum DEXs, so why not have a preference for the DEXs we do have that are more focused on the Arbitrum ecosystem and have done more for the cause?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We encourage a broader outlook on the future of web3 and DeFi. The industry is moving toward a cross-chain and multi-chain approach. Our xSwap feature currently spans seven ecosystems, and the upcoming v2 will extend this to over 30, providing Arbitrum with direct access to users across different chains while unifying liquidity. We believe that forming an island on one chain causes isolation and closes Arbitrum off from accessing a large amount of DeFi users.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>I do not really see this proposal for a bond programme as anything exciting or invigorating for the ecosystem. I understand this is a longer-term proposal and the calculations quite well. Should we not be more focused on something that will ignite the ecosystem and give the boost we so desperately need as soon as possible? Personally, I feel we should, so I\u2019m very interested to hear what others think. I feel we need something more injective and quicker off the bat, something more exciting and attractive for the end user</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our proposal aligns with the recent short-term incentive program, which allocates up to 50M $ARB tokens over the next quarter. Our first sales period aligns with this timeline, requiring a maximum of 12.5M tokens.

In the comment you said \u201cDistributing this much money deserves a dedicated group of thoughtful decision makers, who\u2019s top priority is distributing the funds.\u201d and we absolutely agree! The stakes are high and opportunity cost of doing nothing is real. The goal of The Coalition is to bring together experience from outside and within the Arbitrum ecosystem to facilitate growth and decentralization. Its primary mandate is to reduce the bandwidth requirement of a delegate with tools and detailed research so that they can make more sophisticated decisions. Additionally, we will be able to aid in decision making that allows for more efficient proposal + execution processes. For example, we would have advocated (and created) a custom voting solution in place of 105 votes for the STIP process.</p>\n<p>Similarly, one method of thinking about potential compensation for The Coalition is the man-hours saved across governance participating stakeholders and additional value add in terms of efficient directing of resources within the ecosystem. Using the Arbitrum STIP example, had The Coalition existed during the time, we could have created a custom comprehensive framework for delegates, evaluated all the Arbitrum STIP proposals as a baseline starting point for delegates, and combined that into a more user friendly voting solution. If for example, it would have taken all delegates 50 hours each to evaluate proposals, talk to applicants, give feedback, and vote on proposals, it could have saved 46 (no of delegates with more than 1M ARB) x 50 hours = 2,300 manhours across all delegates. In addition, perhaps the end state of the Arbitrum STIP votes would have benefited the overall ecosystem more due to a more effective distribution.</p>\n<p>The members of The Coalition have full time employees with benefits, and weeks will be allocated across the best suited team. For example, within Gauntlet, it may be the Applied Research team which is currently leading various incentive proposals for Uniswap or Market Risk team doing the USDC migration on Arbitrum. We do not bring single members but rather professional organizations with diverse expertise. With BWR, our onchain analytics team, governance team, grant/incentive frameworks team, or other domain experts may be utilized to the adapting need of the project.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as stated before, BWR takes on the risk of any additional workload beyond the minimum hours in order to achieve the scope of our work.</p>", "author": "BlockworksResearch", "parent_post_title": "Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition", "parent_post_id": 19145}, {"text": "<p>The authors (grant recipient) of any DAO-endorsed grants will need to work with the Arbitrum Foundation on KYC/compliance.

However, we would highlight that any tiered delegation model does add additional administrative friction and consideration which we would want to confirm is within the foundation\u2019s abilities and willingness.</p>\n<p><strong>We will amend the proposal to include the following criteria:</strong></p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c84a58e9e783cb667afd8135f7f325feda474acf.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/szQMvSpaifDCFtR1quB8P9lvmqP.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2023-12-12 at 5.03.40 PM\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c84a58e9e783cb667afd8135f7f325feda474acf_2_690x303.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-12 at 5.03.40 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"szQMvSpaifDCFtR1quB8P9lvmqP\" width=\"690\" height=\"303\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c84a58e9e783cb667afd8135f7f325feda474acf_2_690x303.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c84a58e9e783cb667afd8135f7f325feda474acf_2_1035x454.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c84a58e9e783cb667afd8135f7f325feda474acf_2_1380x606.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E2E2E2\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">Screenshot 2023-12-12 at 5.03.40 PM</span><span class=\"informations\">1482\u00d7652 44 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Total Delegation:</strong> Cumulative ARB delegated to EventHorizonCommunity.eth</li>\n<li><strong>Earliest Date:</strong> Earliest date of ARB delegation</li>\n<li><strong>Passholder Count:</strong> Cumulative number of HVAX Voter Pass Holders</li>\n<li><strong>Proposal Participation:</strong> The percentage of proposals the community voter block participated in over the delegation period</li>\n<li><strong>Average Pass Participation:</strong> The average number of pass holders participating in each proposal.

Regarding Sybil considerations\u2026</h3>\n<p>we would highlight that the allocated sum of delegated ARB is intentionally a minority voter amount by a significant margin. Any potential risk of Sybil influence over the public-access block would under almost all conditions not amount to a sum of authority that would be capable of passing a vote absent incredibly significant broader support from other delegates and ecosystem participants. E.g. a rogue vote is virtually impossible.</p>\n<p>That being said, we would be willing to heighten anti-sybil measures with Gitcoin Passport requirements for Arbitrum meta-governance. Gitcoin Passports allow for the customization and weighting of proof-of-humanity criteria including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Captcha</li>\n<li>Discord Link</li>\n<li>Coinbase Verification</li>\n<li>ENS use</li>\n<li>Wallet Balance</li>\n<li>Wallet Age</li>\n<li>Facebook Link</li>\n<li>Gas Spent</li>\n<li>Civic Uniqueness (<a href=\"https://support.civic.com/hc/en-us/articles/6855280050839-What-is-Civic-Uniqueness-Pass-\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://support.civic.com/hc/en-us/articles/6855280050839-What-is-Civic-Uniqueness-Pass-</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We would recommend a slight customization of standard weighting as to emphasize non-ETH-balance pertaining benchmarks such as linked social media accounts, wallet age, gas used, civic uniqueness, and ENS. We are very open to community discussion on this approach vs standard Gitcoin Passport weighting.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-regarding-responsible-stewardship-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#h-3-regarding-responsible-stewardship-3\"></a>3. Regarding responsible stewardship\u2026</h3>\n<p>we believe this is a particularly difficult concept to quantify objectively. There are certain assurances the team can provide at the protocol and base mechanics level, such as being fully doxxed, legally incorporated, and well-known by various individuals within the community.</p>\n<p>However, it is important to highlight that the public authority block is <em>not</em> a delegation to the Event Horizon team members. In fact, the team will not be voting with voter passes and will remain as neutral an impact as possible.</p>\n<p>Rather, this proposal seeks to delegate ARB to a group of retail voters (Voter Pass holders). So it is very difficult to objectively determine if the decisions of a large swath of previously disenfranchised individuals are \u2018responsible\u2019 or not. We also see risk in becoming a gatekeeper for who can and cannot participate in this open public good voter block. We don\u2019t want the power to deem a voter worthy of this public good, as that opens up potential avenues for abuse and proposal attack. Instead, we stand by the notion that unconditional revocation is a greater catchall to halting irresponsible action in a more democratic fashion.</p>", "author": "EventHorizon", "parent_post_title": "[PROPOSAL] Event Horizon Community Governed, Public-Access Governance Delegation", "parent_post_id": 19792}, {"text": "<p>Hi Curia,</p>\n<p>Thank you for your detailed respons.<br>\nThe Chainlink Node reputation for the price feeds is not yet public. Chainlink uses an internal reputation system.</p>\n<p>Regarding uptime metrics: i shared 3 of our OCR nodes. When a Chainlink node is down or not functioning properly you can see a big gap inbetween the last and newer transactions.<br>\nIf you look at our Polygon OCR node you can see it posts continuous transactions every few seconds and has not experienced any major downtime since it has been live. It already has a history of close to 5million transactions.<br>\nOur internal reputation at Chainlink is among the top. As one of the top performing Chainlink node operators we get a steady flow of jobs. We have recently been given an oppprtunity to deploy on the Base blockchain by Coinbase and we had the opportunity to build a custom usecase for Tangible.Store to bring realestate onchain for USDR collaterizarion usage.</p>\n<p>Regarding incident management:<br>\nWe are a veteran Chainlink node operator. We have numerous custom scripts that help eith failovers and alerting. We have not had any major issues regarding running and maintaining Chainlink nodes for the Chainlink price feeds. Chainlink has never used our emergency redphone yet. We run clusters of 6-8 fullnodes per chain that connect to our own premium endpoint-service.<br>\nBy being one of the initial Node Operators and infrasteucture providers for the GainsNetwork custom DON we have built up a stellar trackrecord. There has not yet been a single oracle exploit or major downtime for GainsNetwork as of today since its inception in 2021. Running a custom Chainlink DON succesfully is one of the hardest things to do in all of DeFi and that\u2019s why we run the only successfull custom DON that is one of the most profitable DONs.</p>\n<p>Regarding performance metrics:<br>\nI have no metrics regarding this. Things you could look at on the adresses i provided are the number of reverted transactions. We have close to none. Our internal reputation with Chainlink is among the top-performing node operators and the same can be said for GainsNetwork. We have also worked together with one of the current validators: Mycelium/PierTwo.<br>\nWe are also one of the initial node operators of the Stake.Link DAO, which consists of only top performing Chainlink node operators.</p>\n<p>Regarding economic indicators:<br>\nYou can check this adress on multiple chains for our economics: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/matrixedlink.eth\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">matrixedlink.eth | Address 0x4dc81f63CB356c1420D4620414f366794072A3a8 | Etherscan</a></p>\n<p>Every $LINK we have earned to date has flown through that adress, so it should be easy for you to calculate everything regarding gas spendings and onchain profits.</p>\n<p>A Dune dashboard is being worked on for metrics as you have requested, but that is not yet released.

We understand the importance of responsible fund management and the need for protocols to demonstrate PMF.</p>\n<p>To clarify, Rage Trade is not a new entrant in the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Moreover, our V1 perps have surpassed a Total Trading volume against Rage\u2019s TVL of around $735m.

The financial report does not include performance metrics. The financial report will have a link to each audit report, and each audit report includes ~80% of the suggested performance metrics.

Right now, 80% of each audit is passed directly to independent security experts / teams, and the remaining 20% is used for operational purposes.

Sherlock does not partake in this type of discounting and instead offers everyday low prices to each customer (treating each customer equally).

In the event of a critical vulnerability being discovered in a live protocol, what is the emergency response plan? How quickly can Cyfrin and/or the community respond to mitigate risks?</strong></p>\n<p>Cyfrin puts every protocol we audit at the top of our priorities, treating each and every case with maximum promptness and attention.</p>\n<p>Before and during private audits, our team provides a tailored security consultation to the protocol. We recommend that protocols themselves have emergency plans defined in the occurrence of an incident.</p>\n<p>Having that said, Cyfrin\u2019s emergency plan if a vulnerability is identified in a live protocol that Cyfrin has been privately audited is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cyfrin team gets notified of the incident. Usually, the protocol reaches out to our team directly via the channels established at the start of the private audit process. At that point, communication lines with the protocol\u2019s engineering team are prioritized and open.</li>\n<li>In high-priority mode, Cyfrin alerts members of the security team with the most context on the protocol. At this point, we act as support in reviewing the mitigation strategy and its implementation.</li>\n<li>Once the event has been contained, the Cyfrin team does a post-mortem review and establishes the cause, impact, and mitigation steps that were implemented. This is shared with the protocol for their review as well and can share this with the DAO, if requested, to provide full context of the incident.<br>\nTo decrease the chances of this ever occurring, our team strongly suggests projects undergo both a private and a competitive audit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hope that answers your questions and, of course, always open to feedback!<br>\n\u2014 Cyfrin team</p>", "author": "Cyfrin", "parent_post_title": "Non-Constitutional AIP: Arbitrum Security Enhancement Fund", "parent_post_id": 19161}, {"text": "<p>I think the proposal that was uploaded to Snapshots does not have the latest updates. could you check if I am wrong?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd295aabe7d3072c4397957e329ba164025c81e5844814388188bd2875d51e447\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd295aabe7d3072c4397957e329ba164025c81e5844814388188bd2875d51e447</a></p>", "author": "axlvaz_SEEDLATAM.eth", "parent_post_title": "Non-Constitutional AIP: Arbitrum Security Enhancement Fund", "parent_post_id": 19161}, {"text": "<p>Hey <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/axlvaz_seedlatam.eth\">@axlvaz_SEEDLATAM.eth</a> ,</p>\n<p>Sadly, Snapshot has a 20k character maximum so we couldn\u2019t upload it all through text.

We don\u2019t involve junior researchers or anonymous contractors in security reviews. Instead, we prefer to have 2-3 LSRs per project to ensure that we provide our clients with the highest quality service. We believe that this approach sets us apart and enables us to deliver the best results for our clients.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that our LSRs do not switch between projects and remain focused on a single codebase throughout the entire audit duration. This focus is essential in providing as much value from security reviews as possible.</p>\n<p>For our <strong>Private Audits</strong>, the $60k cost is a fixed amount, and this is underpinned by the reasons I mentioned earlier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a refusal to include anonymous contractors or junior security researchers,</li>\n<li>a dedication to preventing context switching between projects,</li>\n<li>and our commitment to providing two LSRs for each project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This dedication to quality and depth in our services is something we take great pride in.</p>\n<p>Using the rubric you have proposed to the DAO, these would be the results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The total cost in USD If three LSRs were assigned to the task, it would <strong>cost $60k per week</strong>.</li>\n<li>The time from the start date to the finish date (would it be <strong>24w or 6w)</strong>. Having that said, it\u2019s difficult to assess the codebase without an LSR\u2019s review. Typically, our researchers require about a week for every 1,000 lines of code to conduct a thorough review. However, the duration can vary based on several factors, such as complexity, external dependencies, security posture, testing strategy, and use case.</li>\n<li>The cost to the project is different than the cost to the DAO. The budget for the <strong>project will cover 60% of the cost of the protocol audit, while the protocol is expected to cover the remaining 40%</strong>. However, in certain cases, as defined by the Allocation Committee, such as when a protocol has a significant impact on ecosystem expansion or is deployed on Arbitrum, <strong>an exception may be made, allowing for up to 80% of the audit expenses</strong> to be covered.<br>\nD) Regarding your last question: <em>Assuming 4 Auditors, can you confirm the individual security researchers?</em>.

The Fed targets 2% price inflation and inflation (call it 3.5%) is running hotter than that. <em>What the community should be aware of is that while the 1.75% staking yield is a nominal return, this nominal return is a negative real yield</em> (1.75 - 3.5 &lt; 0).</p>\n<p><strong>Hence, while this 1.75% staking yield seems inflationary on its face, it is less inflationary than the external monetary regime. In fact, on a relative basis it is actually deflationary.</strong></p>\n<p>Beyond these comments, the community could also consider options like burning tokens similar to ETH (which is the equivalent of a share buyback in the equity world). Such actions accrete value to all members of the network (ARB token price goes up as supply goes down when network value remains the same) and move the token in the direction of truly hard money.</p>", "author": "ModalQuant", "parent_post_title": "Request for Comment: Proposal to Activate ARB Staking", "parent_post_id": 16240}, {"text": "<blockquote>\n<p>reasoning for pushing this now instead of waiting until March</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With the given timeframes, and assuming the audit takes a month, and that the contract could be written instantly, we\u2019d be looking at mid-November as earliest possible release.

This is possible as long as the sequencer is online.</p>\n<p>24 hour delays hurt user experience, since any economic mechanism design in a dapp, protocol, or L3 built on top of Arbitrum faces the 24 hour delay.</p>\n<p>Lowering the delay to 4 hours maintains the soft-guarantees of txns inclusion by a sequencer that is online. This improves the user experience of applications using optimistic mechanisms built on top of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>If you pay for your coffee on Arbitrum, the shop keeper can probably accept a soft guarantee, because L1 double spending will cost several cups of coffee in gas fees and the customer needs to shutdown the Offchain Labs sequencer server too.</p>\n<p>If you pay for your lambo on Arbitrum, the car dealership or direct seller should wait for a hard-guarantee, yes even waiting for L1 finality.</p>\n<p>These concerns are about off-chain double spending (yes exchanging goods and services, in the off-chain world, most commonly CEXs).

The usecases of blockchain are much beyond, including prediction markets (eg. futarchy, social media content moderation), global jobs markets (escrow for digital services), Token Curated Registries (TCRs).</p>\n<p>For example, decentralized social media applications, one of my interests. Let\u2019s suppose Reddit, one of the members of the Data Availability committee for Arbitrum Nova would be interested in adopting a decentralized content moderation system based on prediction markets. I made an <a href=\"https://github.com/kleros/kleros-moderate\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">implementation</a> of a similar kind of content moderation system using Reality.Eth and Kleros for Telegram. The idea is much like optimistic rollups, someone makes a claim \u201cThis reddit post titled \u2018Increase the blocksize\u2019 in the subreddit /r/Bitcoin breaks the rules and the user should be banned\u201d and leaves a deposit. Now an optimistic timeout period begins, if no one escalates the claim, the claim is accepted optimistically and the user is banned. If the claim is disputed, then a slow, secure dispute resolution oracle resolves the dispute (blockchain based justice protocol like Kleros). The 24 hour censorship period means that such a content moderation mechanism is bound by 24 hour latency in the optimistic timeout and would negatively impact the user experience on the social media platform. If we used a lower timeout, then we go from King Elon deciding platform censorship to Offchain labs deciding platform censorship <strong>for these types of applications using optimistic timeouts</strong>. Web3 should strive to provide users a 10x better UX, that\u2019s the only way to gain serious adoption.</p>\n<p>Low value, high frequency use cases can work with low latency in blockchain based systems securely as long as they fallback on a secure, slow mechanism. In practice with optimistic timeout periods, most users will experience the timeout period, but some users will escalate to a slow oracle process \u2014 again think blockchain based court. But if a centralized actor such as the sequencer can censor transactions for a 24 hour period, we can\u2019t use a timeout period less than 24 hours.</p>\n<p>In the case of labor markets, consider microtasking usecases such as language translation. Imagine an escrow dapp in which freelancers leave deposits to accept jobs. After completing the translation they submit their work. After a challenge timeout period, they are paid and their deposit is returned, however if challenged, a slow secure oracle is queried to resolve the dispute.

I will stress that the use-cases here are practical, not merely theoretical. Optimistic timeout periods are common across many protocols.</p>\n<p>If there are unaddressed security concerns regarding the current 24 hour delay, I would be happy to be corrected and we can better document the justification for current protocol parameters.

This means users by default use the 1 of 1, just trust offchain-lab assumption, which is fine as long as the sequencer promptly publishes it\u2019s txn batch ordering promise, but it\u2019s not fine when large delays are involved.</p>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"anomalies-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#anomalies-3\"></a>Anomalies</h2>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c8c3e56e496cf8dba5bfe2bff15f90fee2cf8c8d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/sE3co0ebzVotstMNSb2RUM8rEEl.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c8c3e56e496cf8dba5bfe2bff15f90fee2cf8c8d_2_690x472.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"sE3co0ebzVotstMNSb2RUM8rEEl\" width=\"690\" height=\"472\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c8c3e56e496cf8dba5bfe2bff15f90fee2cf8c8d_2_690x472.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c8c3e56e496cf8dba5bfe2bff15f90fee2cf8c8d_2_1035x708.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c8c3e56e496cf8dba5bfe2bff15f90fee2cf8c8d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F7F8\"><div class=\"meta\">\n<svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1174\u00d7804 63.9 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg>\n</div></a></div></p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d2f662185139a22c5abc1bd568e1e711d35b56c6.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/u6g8P7lOqIRAAmXkH9nbMU3YUcK.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d2f662185139a22c5abc1bd568e1e711d35b56c6_2_690x497.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"u6g8P7lOqIRAAmXkH9nbMU3YUcK\" width=\"690\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d2f662185139a22c5abc1bd568e1e711d35b56c6_2_690x497.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d2f662185139a22c5abc1bd568e1e711d35b56c6_2_1035x745.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d2f662185139a22c5abc1bd568e1e711d35b56c6.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F9\"><div class=\"meta\">\n<svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1326\u00d7956 112 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg>\n</div></a></div></p>\n<p>These anomalies could be explained due to poor operational infrastructure; or, for dapp, protocol, and L3 developers, one has to assume the worst that the sequencer is purposely withholding L2 state publishing. No optimistic mechanism design can be used on Arbitrum today safely without 24 hour minimum latency due to protocol design choices. Since the sequencer has complete power for 24 hours to censor and order transactions as it wishes, one cannot build any dapp, protocol, or L3 with a 1 of n trust assumption on Arbitrum without a minimum latency of 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Shorter challenge period in optimistic mechanisms are possible, but this means a 1 of 1 trust assumption. You might as well just use AWS instead of the offchain labs database for the same trust model but better reliability, uptime, and cost.</p>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"summary-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#summary-4\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Considering historical sequencer performance, this proposal would have had zero impact on Arbitrum performance and any \u2018soft confirmation\u2019 had it been effect since the Nitro upgrade. Not once has the sequencer exceeded its 24 hour backdating limit. Had this proposal been in effect since the Nitro upgrade, however, dapps, protocols, and L3s using Optimistic periods in their mechanism design would massively benefit from a 6x decrease in minimum latency from 24 hours to 4 hours.</p>\n<p>This proposal strikes a compromise between applications which don\u2019t care much about security and simply want low latency and are fine with a 1 of 1 trust assumption on the sequencer and the dapp, protocol, and L3 developers who require a 1 of n trust assumption rollup with a user experience with sub 24 hour latency. The current parameters heavily favor the low latency users who don\u2019t care as much about trust assumptions. Based on historical data, this proposal would have had zero impact on the 1 of 1 soft confirmation trust assumption users, and would benefit 1 of n \u2018hard confirmation\u2019 trust assumption users with a 6x reduction in latency.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7d60040456968a3e34c0eb5cdbf43c1d07b6ec85.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hT7oA3hnJZgmL9QwPIqqSJDdBcx.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7d60040456968a3e34c0eb5cdbf43c1d07b6ec85_2_689x430.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"hT7oA3hnJZgmL9QwPIqqSJDdBcx\" width=\"689\" height=\"430\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7d60040456968a3e34c0eb5cdbf43c1d07b6ec85_2_689x430.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7d60040456968a3e34c0eb5cdbf43c1d07b6ec85_2_1033x645.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7d60040456968a3e34c0eb5cdbf43c1d07b6ec85.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECEDF2\"><div class=\"meta\">\n<svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1308\u00d7816 110 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg>\n</div></a></div></p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a6f0d8f2b6822bdcbb5277303b7dbc7d4fd0619a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nOPgWT1CQZnA5h27N7pfes3FSm6.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a6f0d8f2b6822bdcbb5277303b7dbc7d4fd0619a_2_689x430.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"nOPgWT1CQZnA5h27N7pfes3FSm6\" width=\"689\" height=\"430\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a6f0d8f2b6822bdcbb5277303b7dbc7d4fd0619a_2_689x430.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a6f0d8f2b6822bdcbb5277303b7dbc7d4fd0619a_2_1033x645.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a6f0d8f2b6822bdcbb5277303b7dbc7d4fd0619a.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECEBED\"><div class=\"meta\">\n<svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1308\u00d7816 102 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg>\n</div></a></div></p>", "author": "shotaro", "parent_post_title": "Proposal: Decrease Censorship Delay from 24 hours to 4 hours", "parent_post_id": 13047}, {"text": "<h1>\n<a name=\"eli5-what-is-this-proposal-about-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#eli5-what-is-this-proposal-about-1\"></a>ELI5, what is this proposal about?</h1>\n<p>The sequencer is a trusted server ordering transactions off-chain.

We can look at successful programs like Gitcoin QF rounds or Thrivecoin engagement campaigns. We can also review other grants programs that Arbitrum may approve like Questbook. Each of these programs provides one or multiple plays which specialize in producing a specific outcome. We may also discover or even design new plays using existing or new software.</p>\n<p>A best-in-class ecosystem grants program will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find and fund the most impactful outcomes</li>\n<li>Source collective intelligence from the community</li>\n<li>Know which \u201cplay\u201d to use to best produce a specific outcome</li>\n<li>Increase voter participation over time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of our third milestone, we hope to provide a playbook full of proven plays with context to which situations each is best suited. We are not only delivering funding to the ecosystem, but providing long term benefits to all future grants programs! It is ambitious, but not unrealistic.

This opens up the possibility of applications falling under the \u201cno-result\u201d category,</li>\n<li>The decision-making has to be quick while being decentralized. The concept of choosing one domain allocator for the community is to strike the balance between speed and decentralization Having more than one DA for the same domain, increases the TAT - the current process ensures 48 hours of TAT. We also feared a potential friction between the domain allocators during a disagreement, hence we have a very clear distinction of the scope of the domains and the decisions of the domain allocators.</li>\n<li>Single Point of Contact: The communication to applicants is very clear right now at CGP because the domain allocator is the single point of contact for their proposals.

Flexible Voting is an extension to the Governor contract. It allows for the construction of new mechanisms which make governance participation easier, cheaper, and more accessible for GTC holders.</p>\n<p>Flexible Voting was developed by <a href=\"https://scopelift.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ScopeLift </a> as part of our grant from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/uniswapgrants\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Uniswap Grants Program </a>. Before explaining more about Flexible Voting, let me introduce ScopeLift for anyone whose not familiar with us.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"about-scopelift-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#about-scopelift-3\"></a>About ScopeLift</h3>\n<p>ScopeLift is a dev shop focused on crypto. We\u2019re a small technical team with many years of EVM engineering experience. We\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with many great clients including Uniswap, Optimism, Cozy, Endaoment, POAP, and others.</p>\n<p>ScopeLift is a long time friend friend of Gitcoin. W\u2019ve had the privilege of contributing to Gitcoin in various ways over the last few years, including helping to build the cart based checkout experience, the bulk checkout smart contract, the BrightID integration, the integration with zkSync, and the first iteration of dGrants.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re also the team behind <a href=\"https://app.umbra.cash/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Umbra </a>, a stealth address system developed with grant funding from the EF, MolochDAO, and of course Gitcoin <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>ScopeLift received a UGP grant earlier this year to work on Governance related projects. One of those projects is Flexible Voting, which is the subject of this post.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"about-flexible-voting-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#about-flexible-voting-4\"></a>About Flexible Voting</h3>\n<p>Flexible Voting is an extension to the Governor contracts that enables delegates to split their voting weight across For, Against, and Abstain on any given proposal. This capability is especially useful when a contract serves as the delegate.</p>\n<p>By enabling arbitrary contract logic to roll up the voting weight of disparate parties into a single delegated vote, many possibilities are unlocked. Having a contract act as the delegate also means these mechanisms can be implemented without introducing new trust assumptions.</p>\n<p>The inspiration for Flexible Voting came from cUNI (Compound UNI). When a UNI holder deposits their tokens into Compound, they lose the ability to participate in Governance. <a href=\"https://www.comp.xyz/t/setup-community-cuni-voting/440\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Attempts</a> to mitigate this required trust and were <a href=\"https://www.comp.xyz/t/setup-community-cuni-voting/440/8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">gameable </a>. Any holder of GTC who wants to deploy their tokens in DeFi would experience the same issue.</p>\n<p>Flexible Governance fixes this problem. A deposit contract like Compound can delegate its voting weight to another \u201cvoting\u201d contract. That contract in turn can implement its own set of rules enabling DeFi depositors to vote on proposals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/images/transparent.png\" alt=\"flex-voting-diagram\" data-orig-src=\"upload://t7GK8vdM1ieF2z0DR5VgjJPZbCt\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"></p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"other-use-cases-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#other-use-cases-5\"></a>Other Use Cases</h3>\n<p>In addition to allowing token holders to vote while their GTC is active in DeFi, Flexible Voting enables many more use cases, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voting on L2 with bridged tokens</li>\n<li>Shielded voting (i.e. secret/private voting)</li>\n<li>Cheaper subsidized signature based voting</li>\n<li>Easier voting with tokens held by custodians</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For a much more in-depth introduction to Flexible Voting, how we built it, and what it enables, check out post on the <a href=\"https://www.scopelift.co/blog/introducing-flexible-voting\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ScopeLift blog </a>.</strong></p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"next-steps-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#next-steps-6\"></a>Next Steps</h3>\n<p>Flexible Voting is implemented as an extension to the OpenZeppelin Governor contract. It is <a href=\"https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">open source </a>. Adopting it would require a carefully crafted governance proposal to be submitted and voted on. Since the DAO is <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/upgrading-the-gitcoin-governance-contracts/10721\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">actively considering </a> an upgrade to the OpenZeppelin Governor, now would be the perfect opportunity to adopt Flexible Voting, and ScopeLift is committed to helping should the DAO choose to do this.</p>\n<p>We\u2019d love to hear your feedback. If you\u2019re a member of the community and you\u2019d like to help us move Flexible Voting forward for Gitcoin, please get in touch.</p>\n<p>For our part, we\u2019re working to expand the system\u2019s capability by implementing some of the concrete use cases which Flexible Voting makes possible. We\u2019re working to see Flexible Voting, which is backwards compatible with existing Governor tooling, directly and fully supported. We\u2019re also proposing Flexible Voting to other DAOs, including Uniswap, which funded its initial development.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to help us build it, fund it, or get it adopted by another community you\u2019re a part of, reach out!</p>", "author": "DisruptionJoe", "parent_post_title": "Proposal: Count ARB Balance in QiDao Vaults into Voting Power", "parent_post_id": 13949}, {"text": "<p>There is no native functionality for this on our contracts (or on DEXs/lending markets).

We understand that not going through the formal process is less time-consuming, but how will you ensure proper allocation of funds?

This thread should be fine.</p>\n<p>I do however question your statement that the trending delegates feature is currently random. I have noticed that the same delegates have been trending for a while.</p>\n<p>To address this issue, some suggestions could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement a randomized algorithm that selects trending delegates on a rotating basis. I.e. let the DAO decide how randomized this should be, i.e. recommend trending delegates, but also delegates that live in the same region (i.e. Nordic countries, EU and so on).</li>\n<li>Limit the amount of time a delegate can trend in a certain period to give others a chance to be recognized</li>\n<li>Consider weighting the trending algorithm based on factors such as recent activity, proposal success rate, and community engagement - this could be forum activity, posts, and so on. However, this could be easily faked or botted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, enabling username searching under \u201cTrending delegates\u201d would be good since the only way people can find me on the Tally site, is by looking up my address, which isn\u2019t that\u2026 public.</p>\n<p>Also allowing for more customization of profiles (especially the text field and formatting).</p>\n<p>In terms of using AI to identify high-quality posts, it sounds like a great idea in theory. However, for it to work effectively, it would require multiple parameters and active moderation to weed out low-quality posts. If all these parameters wouldn\u2019t be present, I believe it\u2019s going to be hard to get a proper high-quality AI.

Given the current market dynamics, where borrowers are already utilizing the maximum borrowing capacity (a real proof of demand for Abracadabra\u2019s products) there is no need to further incentivize borrowing.<br>\nThis high level of demand has led the DAO to shift its focus. Instead of boosting demand further, which is already exceeding MIM\u2019s availability, the emphasis is now on enhancing liquidity incentives.

For instance, I helped raised $200M for DeSo as COO and oversaw our $50M ecosystem fund. While I was there, we made contingent grants/investments of this size or more. The key was to properly vet the background of the team and have clearly defined milestones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The funds are being allocated as additional reward on the baseline 15% CHAD.D preferred returns, and it will stay within the Arbitrum ecosystem given the current nature of the reward emission. A lot of other projects are currently cross-chain and will immediately begin leaking liquidity into other ecosystems from day 1.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We actually prefer a performance-based structure for this incentive. I.e. If we don\u2019t drive the investors/liquidity en masse, then we can cut off or scale down the incentive. But if this helps boost Arbitrum to the largest RWA position by TVL then it is a no-brainer.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately we have the best private credit product in the entire RWA space. If you can find me a better product from a Yield/Sharpe ratio standpoint happy to learn more.</p>\n<p>But most of the other products are either low-yielding, on chain T-Bills OR sketchy credit products in emerging markets.

The project aims to integrate web3 technologies like on-chain treasuries, a crypto Mastercard to enable customers to spend their crypto in real time, and a neighborhood banking system into the micro-credit model, along with plans for decentralized KYC and proposal-making on-chain.

The venture program does require a SAFE/T commitment from the ventures, which is key for the cross-ownership between ventures, which incentivizes collaborative behavior and is the key to creating network effects, which means the grantees stay in Arbitrum instead of migrating.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>\nWithout said cross-ownership, the narrow topic focus (high overlap) between ventures would create competitive dynamics between them, which is why historically, accelerators have limitations on the amount of collaboration they get from ventures, i.e., a DeFI project can only collaborate so much with an NFT one and a DAO tooling one. If you get a cohort of collab tech (say all DAO tools) they might see each other as competitors and suddenly you can\u2019t run group workshops and they no longer want to support one another.<br>\nWe have solved this problem through cross-ownership, as well as a set of P2P workshop formats (inspired by the work one of our members did deploying $25m of innovation grants for the UK government), and collaborative databases we\u2019ve built for this purpose. Thanks to this we have achieved very deep collaboration between ventures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sharing user research insights</li>\n<li>cross-marketing</li>\n<li>cross-selling their product</li>\n<li>integrations and bias toward modular and composable architecture</li>\n<li>referring talent to one another</li>\n<li>etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Essentially, we have turned entrepreneurship from single-player to multiplayer to reduce the failure and migration rates of grantees, and instead have more sustainable ventures.</p>\n<p>Happy to share more <a href=\"https://meetwithwallet.xyz/daniel\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">over a call</a> if any confusion, doubts or concerns about this remain (I understand how if seen out of context this could create distrust/concerns, so please let me know if any remain!).<br>\nWe also made a forum post about why we believe this approach should be expanded to other ecosystem development programs in Arbitrum.

It\u2019s difficult to understand at the moment. Does Arbitrum governance get equity in the things its funding?

By proxy, the ventures get some equity in each other (so indeed the current cohort could get equity in RnDAO\u2019s previous ventures and vise versa). What this enmeshment does is create alignment between everyone in the cluster, and that encourages collaboration and integrations, which is the goal.<br>\nAs the number of ventures grows, the cluster attains critical mass and starts to attract others organically (it makes more sense to join Arbitrum and integrate with existing tools than try to build everything from scratch somewhere else. Also, as the number of ventures also attracts a lot of talent interested in this vertical, this leads to more ventures being started already in Arbitrum by said talent. And aligned investors will flock too as it becomes the go-to place).</p>\n<p><strong>Additional nouances</strong><br>\nEquity is likely to become of little value if the ventures succeed and tokenize as protocols (which is an ideal scenario, albeit with a degree of uncertainty). Also, the agreements do not enforce an equity transfer but just a SAFE type of instrument (both for RnDAO participation in the ventures and vice versa, as that protects from certain attack vectors and optimizes attention).<br>\nCurrently, the level of funding allocated was for a tiny pilot (about a 1/3 of what we requested for a full pilot); this has led us to focus on validating the ability to attract talent (succeeded with 100+ applications for 6 fellowship slots), and then the design of the fellowship program (which is half the pipeline and is to be followed by the venture building program. Note that the fellowship agreement doesn\u2019t include any equity nor SAFE).<br>\nWe\u2019re hoping to apply for the next stage of pilot funding to validate the model fully and develop the key systems and operational capabilities (currently, we\u2019re running very very lean).<br>\nAfter completing the second pilot cycle (full pilot), we have indeed considered a scenario where if Arbitrum could provide continuous funding for the program, then we could do some form of allocation for Arbitrum (tokens/shares, the legal/tokenomics side here would need some time and budget to be figured out, hence why we\u2019re first validating the operating model). However, note that the value for the treasury is likely to be negligible in the short term and the medium-to-long-term benefit of Arbitrum succeeding to establish itself as a relevant key player in the L2 wars might well outweigh any benefit of participation in the ventures.<br>\nThe other thing to consider is that giving Arbitrum a %, this will further divide the pie and might negatively affect the quality of talent we can attract, especially when compared with more generous programs run by other ecosystems (e.g., Optimism).</p>\n<p>The ideal scenario, as we see it, is that after some initial period of grant funding, the cluster will be mature enough to become self-sustaining, and then Arbitrum will continue getting the benefits without the need to keep funding it. Right now, we\u2019re in a fledging/embryonic stage, and the grant funding has been key to jump-start the network effects.<br>\nA final consideration is that Arbitrum is not funding the total cost but only a fraction. The RnDAO team is working at well below market rate and essentially subsidizing the program in exchange for participation in the ventures. This creates further incentive alignment between all stakeholders as then Arbitrum, the venture founders and teams, and the RnDAO team are all aligned on making sure the ventures succeed (instead of the incentives being to just deploy funding quickly and collect fees).</p>\n<p>Happy to discuss this over a call as we have been researching this for about 3 years now, so there\u2019s quite a bit of nuance to unpack that can easily get lost here.</p>", "author": "danielo", "parent_post_title": "Plurality Labs: Arbitrum DAO x RnDAO Co.lab", "parent_post_id": 20138}, {"text": "<p>This consideration was made to push the experimentation in the ways funds are allocated.

The plan was to never touch Solidity at all, to save time and test player behavior before \u2018locking in\u2019 the game rules in a Smart contract. As we all know, contract development is time-consuming and challenging.</p>\n<p>We also planned on sourcing data from existing protocols data using their subgraph endpoints. We would instead focus more on the event, gathering the people, and making sure the game is played as expected.</p>\n<p>This was a great plan on paper. However, once we began doing our initial tests, we began to discover issues.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original design as presented in the proposal involved the facilitators holding all the funds in a safe. Even though we were willing to tolerate this centralization for the test round, it was still vulnerable to capture.</li>\n<li>Accounting errors. We would have needed to partition the funds in the safe and manually keep track of which funds are going to which project. This meant that we were now tracking everything through spreadsheets, which is error-prone. Again, tolerable for a test round but not ideal.</li>\n<li><strong>The biggest challenges came from the Safe API</strong> . We didn\u2019t know this, but pushing TXs to a Gnosis Safe involved signing, hashing, and posting data to a centralized server. <strong>This gets complicated when you are trying to use Hats</strong> . We could not find a seamless way to make Hats (onchain) work with this API (offchain) without making our ship operators do things manually.\n<ul>\n<li>Also, gas estimation is another issue. Having worked with the Gnosis gas estimation API for MolochDAOs, I\u2019ve learned the challenges of relying on a centralized API for Multicall transactions. It can sometimes be an unnecessary blocker. Also, L2\u2019s calculates gas differently. These challenges are surmountable but weighed in the decision process for steering away from Safe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>So in essence, we had no way of having our ships post grant requests to facilitators.</li>\n<li>Data availability was another issue. We were unprepared for the amount of content required to provide a seamless experience in the app.</li>\n<li>In essence <strong>The code required to make this work would have been more complicated and intensive than what we have currently</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"pivot-1-allo-attempt-1-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#pivot-1-allo-attempt-1-5\"></a>Pivot 1: Allo Attempt 1</h3>\n<p>So at first, we decided to give Allo a go. They had a lot of the things we needed. However, we quickly learned that Allo uses its role system. We made a snap judgment and assumed that the integration may cause more issues than it was worth.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that this was an error on our end. Had we dug a little deeper or met with Zaak earlier (he was on vacation at the time), we would have discovered that the strategies are wide open and we definitely could have made this work.</p>\n<p>However, we didn\u2019t know this so we had another pivot</p>\n<h3><a name=\"pivot-2-vanilla-contract-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#pivot-2-vanilla-contract-6\"></a>Pivot 2: Vanilla contract</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/DAOmasons/request-registry\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Repo Link</a></p>\n<p>We decided to make a contract that wouldn\u2019t handle funds but could handle all the Metadata and amounts. This would at least handle the accounting issues and Metadata needs previously mentioned.</p>\n<p>However, as we began to codify the rules, we began to discover that this plan was creating a lot of extra work. Way more than anticipated.</p>\n<p>Around this time, I started meeting with Zaak from Allo and talked through each of the needs of the project. It was clear that we were going to save some time with Allo.</p>\n<p>One caveat here is that Zaak had mentioned that building a strategy generally takes a couple of days and only involves 100-200 lines of code. This wasn\u2019t the case for us (also most of the strategies in the repo are larger than 100-200 lines of code)</p>\n<h3><a name=\"final-pivot-allo-gamemanagerstrategy-and-grantshipstrategy-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#final-pivot-allo-gamemanagerstrategy-and-grantshipstrategy-7\"></a>Final Pivot: Allo, GameManagerStrategy and GrantShipStrategy</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/DAOmasons/allo-v2/tree/grantShips\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Repo Link</a></p>\n<p>So after this pivot, We doubled down on Allo. Overall, the contracts and tests likely took a couple of weeks of very intensive dev, with some extra time for docs, edits, etc.</p>\n<p>The good news is that the strategies we built are far better than the original vision. Some of the features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increased capture resistance</strong> . No one holds the funds. They can only be withdrawn by certain roles, to one address. Flags are onchain and can stop a ship immediately.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased plurality</strong> . The original plan called for one type of Grant Ship that did grants one way. However, GameManagerStrategy can deploy any type of ship. In the future, we will be able to adapt existing Allo strategies and turn them into GrantShips (ex. Retroactive Ship, MicroGrant Ships, RFP, etc)</li>\n<li><strong>Better UX</strong> . Because our data sources are aligned, there is far less need to send users to other applications. All the data they need will be in front of them. We were also able to reduce the amount of overall transactions needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Record-keeping</strong> . The way we handle and store data is a 10x improvement over what we had initially planned. Better yet, it\u2019s looking like new features recently <a href=\"https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#file-data-sources\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">built on TheGraph</a> are going to allow us to reliably index data from IPFS. This means that we will be able to structure our data in many useful ways, for a wide array of actors, under one API.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, these contracts are tested, and we are confident they suit our needs to play Grant Ships. The direction is solidified. We are currently refining the designs and building the application. Here is a screenshot of the application in action.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"recruitment-progress-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#recruitment-progress-8\"></a>Recruitment Progress</h2>\n<p>The talk on measuring grant impact with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DexeNetwork\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Nexe Protocol </a> went well.

The metrics continued to rise and we had our first distribution of LP Loss Rebates due to SportsAMM LPs on Arbitrum incurring a bad week.

Also, all the ARB meant to be distributed as leveragoors incentives have not been distributed yet because most of the current leveragoors have not closed their positions yet. Since leveragoors can keep their positions open for not more than 30 days, we expect more leveragoors to close their positions soon, and see a spike in ARB distribution in the next epoch (as more leveragoors will realize the yield and get 20% extra ARB incentives).</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of incentives: [Insert Summary]</strong></p>\n<p>Stella received 186,000 ARB for the STIP incentives, out of which 120,000 ARB will go towards incentivizing the lending pools, and 66,000 ARB will go towards incentivizing the profitable leveragoors. Overall, Stella has spent 5,2577 ARB out of the 79,716 ARB received over the duration of STIP, and rolled over the remaining for the next epoch.</p>\n<p>To summarize the effect of the current incentives :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stella has seen a 273% growth in TVL since the Arbitrum STIP incentives went live, and is now the biggest protocol on Arbitrum in the \u2018leveraged farming\u2019 category according to <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocols/leveraged%20farming/Arbitrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFillama</a>.</li>\n<li>Stella has managed to get $5.52M in lending pool TVL (as of 14th Dec 2023).

Stella is currently at $6.5M in TVL, with the TVL seeing an 300% increase since the start of the STIP incentives. Also, 64% of Leverage Positions on Stella have generated a positive yield at ~890% APR on average.</li>\n<li>Stella received 186,000 ARB as incentives for the STIP incentives, out of which 120,000 ARB will go towards incentivizing the lending pools, and 66,000 ARB will go towards incentivizing the profitable leveragoors.</li>\n<li>The objective behind the incentives is two fold :</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Help bootstrap lending liquidity on Stella lending pools, to fulfill the borrowing demand, which will in turn bring higher lending APYs, and kickstart a flywheel. The ARB incentives will be directed towards lending pools with higher utilization rates to attract more liquidity and ensure the judicious use of ARB incentives.</li>\n<li>Give additional 20% profits to leveragoors as incentives on their profitable positions only. This will incentivize good behavior on part of the leveragoors, and prevent against any sybil attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that both, the leveragoor\u2019s and lenders incentives will be auto deposited in the ARB lending pool as ysARB, and will be vested over 30 days over the start of next epoch. This will ensure that the ARB incentives are not dumped and sell pressure is gradually eased.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\"></a>Recap of the Previous Two Weeks</h2>\n<p>ARB Received Last Disbursement: 26,572 ARB</p>\n<p>Total ARB Received: 159,432 ARB</p>\n<p>ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks: 7,850 ARB</p>\n<p>Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ysETH.h: 0x092d4BEe60B9F8904918bA7b0341c0B45f16FB55</li>\n<li>ysETH: 0x5ecb93b3ef882bf42fee65541942d50a7dab4b33</li>\n<li>ysUSDC.e: 0x3251f402Cc06b33E742f08E1ADbE0D2E4C1ea2FA</li>\n<li>ysUSDC: 0x97a57663491ba1f0464d587b4b01ed58e49e4109</li>\n<li>ysUSDT: 0x36569fbc5a9d4c59d71e81d46db24256a09d1ad6</li>\n<li>ysRDNT: 0xc1e2c1f9c4fe278d0db0d3d8eff359f8b235f853</li>\n<li>ysARB: 0xab416E57ec74e87295B8a1507745a954B0bB9F02</li>\n<li>ysPLS: 0x8e50117f0020e3872cea6fb72801d8810f11caf1</li>\n<li>ysGRAIL: 0x5ff4433417543430e49e4cf2565090e4beb46884</li>\n<li>ysSILO: 0x49f24b28d51e28ba5abb65c4392d38b92d4f6f19</li>\n<li>ysLUSD: 0xdf2c91c0d5fe65c39fcb1bf92b3d70f7f7b492d8</li>\n<li>Strategy Gateway: 0xDc6c3dFb237D5202a8eE4d8472A52A94F9282053</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contract address label <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2AYnjAaQjVOLtvemZpsWoN5sTJEJ8dLqdRDExTBQv_SUeug/viewform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Form</a> completed for all addresses: YES</p>\n<p>ARB left over: 59,335 ARB</p>\n<p>Plan for leftover ARB:</p>\n<p>Any additional ARB leftover will be rolled over to the next epoch of incentives.

The two main reasons for justification are:<br>\nA) Unfortunately, we have spoken to many other projects; however, given the complexity of OLM, it has proven difficult to find protocols with extra resources to facilitate this time of partnership and onboarding, and from the feedback we have received, it is unlikely to happen until after the STIP period.<br>\nB) Our contracts emit at a fixed rate until exhausted; thus as we had originally planned on a full distribution date of 2024-01-31 we would have to redeploy all the contracts to change the rate, thus we decided against this option. However, we want to put those 100k Tokens to work for our users, so we will continue to fund the emissions for another month until around 2024-03-05. If the DAO deems this an inappropriate use, Premia is willing to fund it out of pocket. Regardless, 100k is not enough to cover the entirety of the extension, so Premia will have to fund a portion out of pocket.</p>\n<p>In lockstep with this decision, the Secondary Market incentives and Trading Competition have been extended to around 2024-03-05 as well.

We outlined the entire structure in our public proposal, discussed it with Arbitrum in the comments, received approval through community voting, and made the steps for participation clear on our web app. The fact that 90%+ of eligible ARB is being utilized via the oARB system is a testament to its transparency and community support. We\u2019ve even seen entities pull ARB off CEXs like Binance to do the pairing process, bringing more value back to the on-chain world!</p>\n<p>We understand that opinions vary, and it\u2019s perfectly valid if the program doesn\u2019t align with your preferences. However, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that Dolomite adhered to established procedures, and the legitimacy of our proposal is backed by the STIP program\u2019s multi sig, Stable Labs, the broader Arbitrum community, and our users.</p>\n<p>If you believe adjustments are necessary for the grant program\u2019s requirements or rules, we welcome constructive suggestions for consideration in future iterations of Arbitrum\u2019s grant programs. While Dolomite doesn\u2019t control these aspects, we value community input and actively encourage it.</p>\n<p>Our program\u2019s structure was designed with the long-term interests of Arbitrum in mind, aiming to discourage mercenary capital and prevent market disruptions to ARB\u2019s price by spacing out any sell pressure. As a matter of fact, we wanted to initially offer longer vesting periods to offer steeper discounts but couldn\u2019t because it would extend beyond the STIP\u2019s deadline.</p>\n<p>We took user feedback like yours seriously, so we initiated discussions with the multi sig via Stable Labs to incorporate changes like a longer vesting period and the ability to earn a 100% discount (thus completely <em>removing</em> any ability for Dolomite to receive <em>any</em> ETH for users that opt for this 100% discount). Importantly, the proposed changes were approved by these representatives of the Arbitrum DAO, and these representatives saw no wrongdoing in how the program was operating beforehand and knew the program\u2019s mechanics were disclosed prior to being voted on. Despite our efforts, we understand that not everyone\u2019s preferences align with our approach.</p>\n<p>Since these modifications were just approved going into Friday afternoon, we thought it\u2019d be best to address the community early next week about the changes, so they wouldn\u2019t be missed going into a weekend.</p>\n<p>The rewards program is entirely optional, and users are free to explore alternative opportunities within the Arbitrum ecosystem. We respect differing views on the future of Arbitrum and appreciate the diversity of opinions within our community.</p>\n<p>Thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention.

New Lenders &amp; Dynamic Liquidity Provider Airdrop (0 to 2,060,440 ARB)</strong></p>\n<p>Radiant\u2019s milestone-based proposal is intended to ensure that ARB is spent efficiently. However, the dual milestone approach of Incremental TVL in addition to incremental dLP has led to complicated campaign terms.</p>\n<p><strong><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f4a5f691c34c25a798603ada35be51e4c539b350.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/yUg4MQx2Av1iAELIMuEoMwUtCtq.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f4a5f691c34c25a798603ada35be51e4c539b350.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"yUg4MQx2Av1iAELIMuEoMwUtCtq\" width=\"624\" height=\"61\" data-dominant-color=\"D7D9DD\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1123\u00d7111 8.35 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></strong></p>\n<p>To provide clarity to the community, Radiant will use the below-updated milestones, which are more straightforward and compelling.

Silo Finance: RDNT Isolated Market Incentives (50,000 ARB)</strong></p>\n<p>Radiant DAO will be collaborating with Silo Finance to create a lend/borrow market for the RDNT token on Arbitrum. Radiant will provide Silo Finance with 50,000 ARB from the STIP allocation for the entirety of the STIP duration to bootstrap demand for the market. We think adding this type of utility to the RDNT token will be a net benefit to Radiant and Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The 50,000 ARB will be redirected from the pending GMX v2 initiative. If Radiant can launch this market before the end of the STIP duration, then we will shift ARB from the Camelot/Dopex initiative.</p>\n<p>Radiant will transfer 50,000 ARB to Silo\u2019s Arbitrum Market Making Safe, after which the Silo team will perform the necessary transactions to incentivize the new market.

New Lenders &amp; Dynamic Liquidity Provider Airdrop (0 to 2,060,440 ARB)</strong></p>\n<p>Radiant\u2019s milestone-based proposal is intended to ensure that ARB is spent efficiently. However, the dual milestone approach of Incremental TVL in addition to incremental dLP has led to complicated campaign terms.</p>\n<p><strong><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f4a5f691c34c25a798603ada35be51e4c539b350.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/yUg4MQx2Av1iAELIMuEoMwUtCtq.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f4a5f691c34c25a798603ada35be51e4c539b350.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"yUg4MQx2Av1iAELIMuEoMwUtCtq\" width=\"624\" height=\"61\" data-dominant-color=\"D7D9DD\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1123\u00d7111 8.35 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></strong></p>\n<p>To provide clarity to the community, Radiant will use the below-updated milestones, which are more straightforward and compelling.

Silo Finance: RDNT Isolated Market Incentives (50,000 ARB)</strong></p>\n<p>Radiant DAO will be collaborating with Silo Finance to create a lend/borrow market for the RDNT token on Arbitrum. Radiant will provide Silo Finance with 50,000 ARB from the STIP allocation for the entirety of the STIP duration to bootstrap demand for the market. We think adding this type of utility to the RDNT token will be a net benefit to Radiant and Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The 50,000 ARB will be redirected from the pending GMX v2 initiative. If Radiant can launch this market before the end of the STIP duration, then we will shift ARB from the Camelot/Dopex initiative.</p>\n<p>Radiant will transfer 50,000 ARB to Silo\u2019s Arbitrum Market Making Safe, after which the Silo team will perform the necessary transactions to incentivize the new market. Radiant will update all contracts incentivized on our Transparency dashboard and with Open Block Labs, and provide metrics.</p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/67671399681edc6f060c828513e38090fb19c40f.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"eKK1eKAXCwshlhaPMmuAKgW5kfB\" width=\"533\" height=\"55\" role=\"presentation\"></strong></p>\n<p><strong>3.

With that, we\u2019ve achieved all milestones as indicated in our STIP proposal.</p>\n<p>More details below:<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/673944a4f52a06b9e623fc25fb49a9ec5389d421.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/eJ9SiTR7R2jNgVm1qtH0sZZOYHD.png?dl=1\" title=\"Untitled (7)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/673944a4f52a06b9e623fc25fb49a9ec5389d421_2_690x346.png\" alt=\"Untitled (7)\" data-base62-sha1=\"eJ9SiTR7R2jNgVm1qtH0sZZOYHD\" width=\"690\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/673944a4f52a06b9e623fc25fb49a9ec5389d421_2_690x346.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/673944a4f52a06b9e623fc25fb49a9ec5389d421.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/673944a4f52a06b9e623fc25fb49a9ec5389d421.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F2F5FB\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">Untitled (7)</span><span class=\"informations\">928\u00d7466 27.7 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Biggest TVL growths in the last 2 weeks:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pool</th>\n<th>TVL Change</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>weETH 25APR2024</td>\n<td>146M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>rsETH 25APR2024</td>\n<td>46M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>aUSDC 27JUN2024</td>\n<td>1.9M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sETH-wstEthSilo 26DEC2024</td>\n<td>1.7M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>gDAI 28MAR2024</td>\n<td>1.6M</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9e840fcf12b140f2022e274b4a800f3525b27796.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/mCinDQha4RgBIC5kEXPFw55r1Ou.png?dl=1\" title=\"Untitled (8)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9e840fcf12b140f2022e274b4a800f3525b27796.png\" alt=\"Untitled (8)\" data-base62-sha1=\"mCinDQha4RgBIC5kEXPFw55r1Ou\" width=\"690\" height=\"356\" data-dominant-color=\"EEF3F5\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">Untitled (8)</span><span class=\"informations\">1409\u00d7727 8.12 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Highest Volume pools in the last 2 weeks:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pool</th>\n<th>Trading Volume</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>weETH 25APR2024</td>\n<td>241M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>rsETH 25APR2024</td>\n<td>68M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>aUSDC 27JUN2024</td>\n<td>14M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>gDAI 28MAR2024</td>\n<td>8M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GLP 28MAR2024</td>\n<td>2.3M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>mPendle 26SEP2024</td>\n<td>1.2M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>rETH 26JUN2025</td>\n<td>1.1M</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/30c61b1f67db8974ddbfbc861f47de8991184343.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6XtmewBGE9iigy2wNeJyRY3A2yL.png?dl=1\" title=\"Untitled (9)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/30c61b1f67db8974ddbfbc861f47de8991184343_2_690x419.png\" alt=\"Untitled (9)\" data-base62-sha1=\"6XtmewBGE9iigy2wNeJyRY3A2yL\" width=\"690\" height=\"419\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/30c61b1f67db8974ddbfbc861f47de8991184343_2_690x419.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/30c61b1f67db8974ddbfbc861f47de8991184343_2_1035x628.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/30c61b1f67db8974ddbfbc861f47de8991184343.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F8F9\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">Untitled (9)</span><span class=\"informations\">1117\u00d7679 16.9 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>The ARB allocation breakdown for LPs for the last 2 epochs is listed below:</p>\n<p><strong>8th Feb.

It has been announced that the final disbursement of the remaining 214,285 ARB emissions will be sent in two batches within the next 24 hours to allow all time zones an equal opportunity to claim.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, to rectify the initial over emission rates in the program, we adjusted the daily oARB distribution to 3,000 oARB. This change aligns the emission rate with the intended total distribution of 750k ARB. As a result of these modifications and the timing of the final ARB disbursement, the overall oARB over emissions are projected to be just over 2%. We expect the final ARB to be claimed and vested within a week.

The audit started Sept 25 and is expected to conclude on the week of Oct 16 or 23 for initial findings, which would be in line with grant dispersion timeframe.</li>\n<li>At the time of writing our 2 largest pools by TVL are Arbitrum native jUSDC and plvGLP, Rodeo accounts for ~7.6% and ~13.3% of the underlying vault TVL respectively.

Here\u2019s a curated list for Arbitrum grantees:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Break Up Your Order</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid liquidating your entire position simultaneously. Segment your order into manageable portions and execute them incrementally via limit orders.</li>\n<li>This phased approach stabilizes the price by curtailing any abrupt shocks to supply and demand</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use Limit Orders</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forego the allure of market orders, which transact instantaneously at prevailing market prices. Instead, employ limit orders letting you set ARB price levels to liquidate at.</li>\n<li>Limit orders might not always be fully executed if the market doesn\u2019t reach your designated price. However, traders can use stop-limit orders to optimize further.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trade During Peak Hours</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Engage in liquidation activities when trading volumes are at their zenith, typically during peak hours.</li>\n<li>Elevated volumes more comfortably accommodate heftier trades, mitigating drastic price deviations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Collaborate and Liquidate</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If multiple grantees or projects are contemplating sizeable liquidations, coordination is beneficial</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stay Informed</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t dump in FUD. Regularly review market conditions, news, and sentiment. An informed decision, based on current market health, can significantly affect outcomes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Strategic liquidation, especially with collaboration and adherence to these best practices, ensures grantees reap the full value of their awards. Moreover, it provides a more stable and healthier market ecosystem for everyone.</p>\n<p>In the following days, we will provide price impact models to help determine strategies for even larger liquidations.

I find <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/plurality-labs-milestone-1-review/20198/5\">your conclusion post</a> way below my expectations of what a conclusion post for a three month working group results should be. It didn\u2019t even mention some of your activities (like the treasury spending recommendation).</p>\n<p>You mentioned above that I only take into consideration the simplified cost breakdown between your working group and service providers and not the detailed work breakdown you presented above. Yes! But this simplified cost breakdown is the only thing that I had up until your response above, how was I supposed to know about it if you haven\u2019t shared it before? How are other delegates supposed to know about it and take it into account (when considering extension of your working group for \u201cseason 2\u201d that you\u2019ve mentioned in the post) if you posted a conclusion post (not mentioning that more detailed report is coming) that didn\u2019t contain specific details?</p>\n<p>I think we can do better as a DAO in terms of accountability. And I know for a fact that you can do better as well, that\u2019s the sole reason why I limited myself with criticism but rather asked you directly for more information (first time in the TG group just after you published you conclusion, second  time yesterday when we spoke).</p>\n<p>And I do in fact believe it should not be me (or any other delegate) calling that out in this case, but that\u2019s a topic for a totally separate discussion.</p>", "author": "krst", "parent_post_title": "Plurality Labs Milestone 1 Review", "parent_post_id": 20198}, {"text": "<p>I support this proposal by Savvy for an Arbitrum Foundation grant.

This is not a DeFi protocol so the way incentives are distributed is not as people are use to. We\u2019ll update the proposal to make sure its clearer after this post.</p>\n<p>Our focus for all our objectives is to create second-order effects. So our incentives for ANIMA LP are centered around that.</p>\n<p>Players are incentivized to become a Liquidity Provider and vest their LP tokens into the game. By doing so, they are rewarded with in-game boosts when they Battle and perform other activities. This allows them to receive more $ANIMA which they then use to level up their Adventurers.</p>\n<p>As seen in the image above, we have a Leaderboard that tracks their staked LP tokens and the percentage of those tokens that they staked. That gives them a position on the Leaderboard.</p>\n<p>We will be using a similar Leaderboard for the ARB Incentives. The higher your position, the more Incentives you\u2019ll get. What this creates is a competition between players where they must strategize what position best suits their risk tolerance and incentive potential. Being a Liquidity Provider does not guarantee you incentives, you must compete.</p>\n<p>So what value does this create?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased ANIMA demand</li>\n<li>Increased demand for Liquidity Providers</li>\n<li>Increased liquidity</li>\n<li>Increased activity on-chain through Realm activities</li>\n<li>Increased activity for MagicSwap</li>\n<li>Increased activity in other protocols(i.e. dex/cex and connected games) with new liquidity</li>\n<li>Increased value of ANIMA, which incentivizes Realm game loops which in turn creates more activity, which benefits Arbitrum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these increases benefit Arbitrum as it represents activity on-chain. As you can start to see, it creates a flywheel that fuels itself and fuels all the networks it\u2019s connected to. The grant supercharges all these activity(game) loops and will continue to provide value even after the grant incentives are gone.</p>\n<p>To use an analogy, this grant is like an initial investment in a startup. It provides the necessary boost to get things flowing, but once the cash flow starts, the business\u2019s revenue, growth and momentum can sustain and amplify itself.</p>", "author": "jona", "parent_post_title": "[REALM] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]", "parent_post_id": 17423}, {"text": "<p>Appreciate the informative response</p>\n<p>My names were skimmed from your supplied images.</p>\n<p>Re the LP incentives, so basically as an LP if you lock for longer you get a larger share of rewards?

I get that you want a big flywheel boost immediately and that it will give wider benefits to your local ecosystem the the bigger the flywheel is.</p>\n<p>But that is also the point of every single grant, boosting a key product to create a stronger flywheel and/or create a boost of surrounding protocols etc.</p>\n<p>Your grant is still very large for the existing impact of Realm when you compare to other protocols/projects.

It\u2019s <strong>not an attempt to be purposely ambiguous</strong>, but more to have <strong>flexibility</strong> about how we\u2019re going to be distributing incentives. In our experience, these kinds of choices are made with the most possible information, closer to game time.</p>\n<p>We have six different AMMs we can incentivize. (Uniswap, SushiSwap, Ramses, Camelot, Zyberswap, and PancakeSwap). They all have different strengths and attributes. I assume all of them will also be posting their own grant proposals here. We also assume that other liquidity managers, aggregators, and other platforms will be applying as well.</p>\n<p>As an example, right now. <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arrakis-finance-draft-stip-round-1/16565/13\">there is a proposal</a> to do quite a bit of incentives on LST pairs on Uniswap. If that passes, it would definitely influence how we would choose pairs to best help the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Likewise, our exchange partners like Camelot, Ramses, and others are likely going to apply for incentives with strategies in mind. It\u2019s important to understand where they\u2019re headed so we can make the best choices to support Arbitrum. To their credit, they all have their own agendas and ideas about where incentives need to go, and it\u2019s totally fair for them to have a stake in that.</p>\n<p>But I can offer some guidance on how Gamma will pick pairs.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Native pairs to Arbitrum (these pairs tend to need the most liquidity and are undercapitalized)</li>\n<li>Critical infrastructure pairs (WETH, ARB, WBTC, stablecoins, and most users regularly use)</li>\n<li>Pairs that play to the strengths of the AMM they\u2019re on.</li>\n<li>Avoiding already incentivized pairs by another organization</li>\n<li>Avoiding overcapitalized pairs</li>\n<li>Structuring incentives so AMMs are not working against each other inefficiently</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope this sheds some light on our approach.

This approach aligns with the needs of liquidity providers (LPs) seeking exposure to a token and willing to lock their liquidity to participate in governance and/or receive additional economic incentives.</p>\n<p>Programs like Radiant\u2019s highly successful dLP governance system use 80/20 pools to create a stable basis of locked liquidity.  This brings security and stability in the market.  This depth enables others to build and deploy technology, including other AMM pools, that are able to function better because this deep liquidity exists.

This creates price stability and a safe trading environment for the coin. My guess is that most of the flows through that pool are arbitrage with other CEXes and DEXes but that\u2019s ok.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s exactly what a ve80/20 pool is for. RDNT has some of the deepest liquidity of any gov token on Arbitrum as a result. We consider our relationship with Radiant a shining example of how Balancer can help DAOs innovate and win with our unique technology. Besides veBAL itself, it is by far the most successful ve80/20 system to have seen the light of day so far. It is the crown jewel of our Arbitrum presence.</p>\n<p>This grant program gives an extra boost to anyone who wants to try doing something similar with ve80/20 type systems.

I haven\u2019t seen clear, detailed research comparing how wstETH/ETH LPs fair in both these situations, but perhaps we should do it/fund it some day.</p>\n<p>Balancer has moved to using an amplification factor of 5000 on most of our LST stableswap pools.

A big part of Balancer\u2019s purpose is to optimise liquidity to fulfil the requirements of many stakeholders. We\u2019ve found that lowering our swap fees to slightly below Uniswap can often attract a lot more liquidity, and even sometimes an increase in fees total fees to LPs as a result.</p>\n<p>Your question has prompted a little test.

That being said <a href=\"https://app.aura.finance/#/42161/aurabal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aura</a> is a very close partner of ours.  Together we launched Balancer\u2019s multichain boost system focusing on Arbitrum first.</p>\n<p>The majority portion of our Airdrop funds was used to setup AURA/ARB/BAL liquidity on Arbitrum, which is the only source of deep AURA liquidity off mainnet, and the deepest source of BAL liquidity as well.    Further we have worked closely with Aura to build liquidity for auraBAL there, and are coordinating aggregators like 1inch to make sure that tokens paired with wstETH (like auraBAL) always route well on Arbitrum.   Basically if you want to farm Balancer and not pay for Mainnet gas, you find the liquidty and tooling you need homed on Arbitrum, with the ability to bridge to/from other chains.</p>\n<p>The 7500 $ARB per week we requested to enable wstETH/USDC liquidty is part of our attempt to make it easy for DAOs to start pairing with LSTs.  This offers better returns to LPs, but there are still some routing concerns that need a bit of work and attention.

In regards to why we believe it is not an astronomically outlandish ask, is due to the nature of how our system operates. We are a <strong>Protocol for Protocols</strong>; hard stop.

ARB is not a dumping coin to enrich people, but rather a medium of membership/participation in the Arbitrum governing scene. Liquidity on Arbitrum via yield farming is not something that is desolate. You can find plenty TVL cooped up on plenty projects on the network. pool2 and yield farming incentives are only effective when the only goal is to stimulate TVL and deepen the underlying liquidity of a token, which ARB does not in-fact have a liquidity crisis on (like $OP did when their first grants came out).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Grants, while not exclusively for innovation, should consider promoting an ecosystem\u2019s \u201cedge\u201d and differences. There are lots of great projects that are native to Arbitrum, which we love collaborating with, who fit this category. We believe that the projects working hard and innovating daily will be the true silver-lining for the next wave of explosive growth in DeFi.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Efficiency/metrics \u2013 we have been blessed to experience immense growth and bleeding edge efficiency with our novel take on both ve(3,3) and concentrated liquidity incentivization. For the foreseeable past, RAMSES has performed as the most efficient volume to TVL AMM on the network. This is strictly a technological edge, not any sort of financial incentive outside of regular means of operation. We believe TVL is important, but we also believe what is more important is <strong>useful TVL.</strong> The same can be said about volume, which can be artificially inflated/spoofed on honeypot tokens or other types of low-impact coins. Useful TVL and volume is the pinnacle of an AMM, which serves as the lifeblood of any DeFi ecosystem. RAMSES focuses strictly on usefulness and I believe we have achieved great strides in this manner.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I appreciate you taking the time to read and provide your input, and our team is more than happy to try and respond to any other concerns/questions you have to our responses.</p>", "author": "Dog", "parent_post_title": "[RAMSES] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]", "parent_post_id": 16856}, {"text": "<p>Thanks for all your answers, but I have to disagree with most of your points, and you didn\u2019t address the most important part.</p>\n<p>The grant you\u2019re asking won\u2019t go to Arbitrum ecosystem projects, it will go to veRAM and incentivize people to buy RAM and lock it, not to provide liquidity.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not the biggest advocate of direct liquidity incentives, but your approach doesn\u2019t solve anything, it\u2019s actually even worse in terms of efficiency.

It would be much more fair if you cared about veRAM metrics instead in terms of valuing the token.</p>\n<p>When analyzing a DEX I suggest you take a deep dive on the metrics that really matter, which is mostly how much revenue it generates vs how much it emits and how much volume it generates for the chain, and also check how fairly is that revenue distributed.</p>\n<p>Respectfully.</p>", "author": "whereismymind", "parent_post_title": "[RAMSES] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]", "parent_post_id": 16856}, {"text": "<p>The proposal is revised and adjusted according to your inputs.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for the constructive feedback and the heads up!</p>", "author": "padzank", "parent_post_title": "[Thales] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]", "parent_post_id": 16836}, {"text": "<p>Thank you for making these changes!

We are completely different than other onchain derivative products and should not be looked at under the same KPIs. Due to the <code>high risk/high reward</code> binary nature of our product, our capital efficiency of collateral liquidity is much much higher than perp and vanilla option products, meaning that we can cater to demand sufficiently with much lower total TVL. Matter of fact, the growth of our TVL is limited due to THALES token gating where only stakers have the luxury to LP into the AMM pools. Conclusion is: the performance of our products should be weighted by onchain activity such as unique users, fee accrual and volume.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>e.g. for past couple couple weeks we averaged around ~400 weekly unique users on Optimism contracts without any incentives,  while Arbitrum contracts are less than half that on average. This activity is present ever since we depleted our Optimism incentives from OP grants, meaning that we maintain a solid post-incentives user retention numbers. We wish to do the same on Arbitrum with this moderate ARB grant.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Trading competitions are only a small part of the 160k ARB Focused Event Incentives, while the direct usage incentives are a total of 340k ARB. This means that trading competition incentives will be around ~10% to ~15% of this grant. Also, Trading Competitions as a growth tool for product such as our own should not be underestimated. We observed that promoting incentivized Trading Competitions on mainnet not only drive immediate usage and volume, but also increases the number of active regular users that stick around after trying out our products for the competition.</li>\n</ol>", "author": "padzank", "parent_post_title": "[Thales] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]", "parent_post_id": 16836}, {"text": "<p>Thank you for answering in detail and making the proposal clearer.</p>", "author": "ITUblockchain", "parent_post_title": "[Thales] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]", "parent_post_id": 16836}, {"text": "<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/rugmeonce\">@RugMeOnce</a>,</p>\n<p>Thank you for voicing your concerns.

Since Gains fee model is slightly more complicated compared to other integrated protocols on MUX, we previously didn\u2019t realize how ReferralFee is handled. After reaching out to the Gains team, we now understand the referral fees will be taken from DevGov and SssFee, meaning they should be part of them instead of being treated as a standalone fee. With this context, we can look into adding ReferralFee to the rebate scope as well. As a reference, for GMX positions, since open &amp; close fees are just two fees and the referral rebate will be handled after the full open &amp; close fees are charged, it didn\u2019t cause as much confusion when it comes to the $ARB rebates.</p>\n<p>We certainly don\u2019t have any ill intentions as the MUX rebate program is applied to all integrated protocols unconditionally, and all the income earned will directly go to the integrated protocols. In the case you countered, all the fees you paid went to Gains first, and MUX used the Aggregator grant to rebate the fees covered by the scope. The ReferallFee not being covered in the scope is caused by our understanding of how the Gains fee structure works. Regarding the technical difficulties, unfortunately, we can\u2019t really cross it and there isn\u2019t much we can do about it.</p>\n<p>In addition, based on the reduced total grant size, the market volatility, and the potentially extended STIP timeline, the rebate rate and scope can be adjusted along the way to accommodate the program and expectations. The original proposal has also indicated possible adjustments, so I hope these factors can be taken into consideration as well.</p>", "author": "realdumbird", "parent_post_title": "MUX STIP grant is not being upheld", "parent_post_id": 19705}, {"text": "<p>Great to see these going out!</p>", "author": "lindsey", "parent_post_title": "STIP Funding Stream Updates", "parent_post_id": 19337}, {"text": "<p>Ser this dashboard is quite good but plus report to hedgey to add at least a label next to the distribution to know the destination protocols.

This requires a couple discovery calls. We can record grant matching data from the grantees for every cycle and the STIP team will be updated accordingly. It is understood that in most cases, grant matching will neither be regular (deployment of matching grant for every cycle) nor even (different volumes deployed over different cycles). Many grantees have not publicly committed to matching funds, we expect them to make some form of matching and will be continuously tracking in bi-weekly syncs (cycles). Another interesting phenomenon is a spending spree in many public organizations at the end of fiscal year due to the use-it-or-loose-it budget rules. where the public departments go on a spending spree at the end of fiscal year to fully utilize budget funds which will otherwise be returned back after end of fiscal year. There might be a similar application here that certain grantees may commit disproportionate amount of matching funds during the ending of monitoring program which may additionally skew results. For these reasons, the team thinks it is necessary to document Grant matching commitments and efforts by grantees for each cycle. Short term ROI as a change in metrics will be mentioned in bi-weekly sync. Full analysis of the program is only possible in the long term. A comprehensive ROI analysis will be included in the final report.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bi-weekly virtual meetings (google meet) . The AG team will be available for async comms throughout the cycle (2 week time between reports) for the full program duration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Data will 100% be available via APIs and Download extract. Since we already have existing tooling and speed to market we aim to have a open source frontend site at the end of the engagement. The main factor will be timing, hosting and maintenance discussion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apologies for the confusion.

Data is the first step in our interaction with Ecosystems. Our latest engagement with Kava, where AG team was tasked with sourcing Grant applicants for KAVA Rise program. Alphagrowth sourced a total of 2100+ applications, out of which we brought 89 applications to Kava. The impact was an increase in TVL on the relatively new chain by $80M (Around ~40% Chain TVL sourced through the grants program). This is where we analyzed the grant efficiency, the application of pareto principle (80/20 success) and more. Furthermore, the applicants were managed on the Alphagrowth platform itself, showcasing the robustness of the platform to easily handle more than 2100 applications. Each of these applications was analyzed by our research team before giving our recommendations to the KAVA team.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>", "author": "sharp", "parent_post_title": "STIP Monitoring - Objective 1&2- Arbitrum Attribution by AlphaGrowth - [FINAL]", "parent_post_id": 18947}, {"text": "<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/burns\">@burns</a> thank you for your questions.  We want to be sure to be clear that we will be working on the Objective 1 for the STIP monitoring  proposal.  We have had a ton of internal discussions on how to quantify and qualify what how to meet and beat this objective.</p>\n<p>The first item is that we will 100% build tooling and dashboards to track:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the grant deployement</li>\n<li>the deployment from the protocol multsig</li>\n<li>the deployment to incentive contracts on the different pools and protocols</li>\n<li>the funding flows up to when the claimant receives incentive</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Where we started to debate internally on was on the following request \u201cclaimant analysis, and any other signals\u201d.  We have 3 options for this and would love feedback.</p>\n<p>The first option, is outsourcing this objective. Chainanalysis specializes in exactly this type of request wallet tracking.  For the past 10 years Chainanalysis <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> priority is to track wallets, mixers, transactions and suspicious activity.  Having understood a little under the hood what they built this is likely the best wholistic solution to detect suspicious activity around the incentives and token distribution.  The amount data and resources needed for Circle node wash trade detection or Neighbor node detection is not something to take on lightly.  That combined with trying to track and unwind distributions to privacy mixers is a specialist undertaking.  Chainanalysis has an off the shelf product as well as post facto investigative services for hire.</p>\n<p>The second option is that we can track claimant wallets and ARB token on a dune dashboard.  The dashboard will contain stats on wallets that received ARB and how much across activities and protocols. This way, if needed, we can retro actively do an analysis on the on the least effective incentive programs. Which brings up option <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3</span>.</p>\n<p>Third option. From our understanding, the goal is to track incentive effectiveness. Learning how protocols are using incentives to grow and sustain KPIs are more important than the 1000 ways not to use incentives.  Tracking all the brilliant ways claimants and potentially protocols will try to game the system while fun may not be incredibly useful in truly understanding exactly the best way to deploy incentives.  Things like team farming, when pooled into the base protocol, is beneficial if it helps make the protocol more capital efficient.  The responsibility lies with the protocol on how to deploy incentives correctly.  If the protocol growth is limited from misplaced incentives, whether malice or negligence does it make a difference? Ultimately the protocol reputation is on the line.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to feedback on which path the STIP committee is interested in pursuing.</p>", "author": "bryancolligan", "parent_post_title": "STIP Monitoring - Objective 1&2- Arbitrum Attribution by AlphaGrowth - [FINAL]", "parent_post_id": 18947}, {"text": "<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"OpenOcean\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"17564\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/openocean/48/4151_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> OpenOcean:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Referral</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Hey Matt, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/matt_stablelab\">@Matt_StableLab</a> Thank you for your kind feedback on our application.

Refer to our <a href=\"https://docs.openocean.finance/swap/referral-program\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">previously successful referral program here.</a></p>\n<p>We will implement anti-Sybil Attack measures and prohibit self-invites to maintain the program\u2019s integrity.</p>\n<p>We hope this addresses the concern, and we are open to modifying the referral program to fully comply with grant policies. Could we retain the referral program given these clarifications?</p>\n<p><strong>2. Please disclose which contracts you will be incentivizing for the \u201cPartnership Incentive Program to traders\u201d portion of your application.</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose of the \u201cPartnership Incentive Program to traders\u201d segment is to attract more partners to join the Arbitrum ecosystem and to draw partners\u2019 users to Arbitrum through the integration of OpenOcean\u2018s easy-to-use Arbitrum API/SDK &amp; Widget.</p>\n<p>We will initiate integration with wallets, DeFi projects, decentralized game projects, and any other projects on Arbitrum that may involve trading function to realize this goal.</p>\n<p>Due to market fluctuations, we will disclose the addresses of the contracts we intend to incentivize upon completion of the integration process.</p>", "author": "OpenOcean", "parent_post_title": "[OpenOcean] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]", "parent_post_id": 17564}, {"text": "<p>Thank you for this clarification and these edits!

Here are our replies:</p>\n<p><strong>1. What ecosystem metrics will be shown in the dashboard? Is there any deviation from those in the RFQ?</strong></p>\n<p>We\u2019ll be showing the metrics as defined in the RFP - TVL, Transactions, Users, Fees Generated, Volume.</p>\n<p>On top of this, we do intend to present several different cuts of data including 1) growth of the above metrics from incentive start date, 2) TVL, transactions, users, fees generated, volume arising from new addresses that have never interacted with the contracts, 3) average depositor stay duration for vault depositors, 4) retention rate for traders.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Will grant matching and ROIs be tracked/displayed? If so, how is ROI determined?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Grant matching</strong>: Yes, grant matching will be displayed.</p>\n<p><strong>ROI:</strong> We also intend to show ROI, this can be defined as</p>\n<p>For pools:<br>\n<code> ROI = (TVL increase vs. baseline) / (value of ARB + grant matching emitted)</code><br>\nwhere baseline = Average TVL from T-2 weeks to T-1 week</p>\n<p>For trading volume:<br>\n<code> ROI = (Trading volume or fee increase vs. baseline) / (value of ARB + grant matching emitted)</code><br>\nwhere baseline = Average TVL from T-2 weeks to T-1 week</p>\n<p><strong>3. Please expand more on what the final report covers - eg assessment of incentive effectiveness, creation of value, recommendations for future programs or summary of data only.</strong></p>\n<p>This will not just be a summary of data. It is probably best to show some a sample conclusion will can be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perp DEXs incentives specifically targeted at trading rebates are the most effective in terms of ROI, which generates $X of trading activity per $ of incentive spend. More importantly, user retention is higher than average at X% 3 months after emissions end. As compared to this, direct emissions that are framed as \u201ctrade to earn\u201d do not have a similar effect. We recommend future incentive programs for perp DEXs to focus on trading rebates as a result.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea here is to provide actionable recommendations that can be used or added to an \u201cincentive playbook\u201d and not just putting data together.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

More people want grants than people initially thought. The demand is about 74 million ARB, much more than the 50 million ARB the foundation had planned for. This shows the community is enthusiastic about supporting projects and growing the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The idea to extend the grant program makes sense, and here\u2019s why:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Fairness</strong>: You mentioned fairness, and I agree. The unexpected demand for grants and the absence of a round 2 could mean some projects miss out on the chance to apply for funding. This isn\u2019t fair to those projects and doesn\u2019t help the ecosystem grow equally. Using ranked choice voting would make the decision process fairer and allow us to consider all projects more equally. This would reduce some blatant lobbying and \u201chorse trading\u201d (favors/backdoor deals) that have been happening.</li>\n<li><strong>Variety of Projects</strong>: Ecosystems are healthiest when they have all sorts of projects, big and small. Big projects are essential, but we (the community) also need smaller ones that can become big in the future. Extending the grant program lets us support big, established projects and the more petite, promising ones. Ranked choice voting helps us make these choices more carefully and ensures a mix of projects that benefit the ecosystem to grow and thrive.</li>\n<li><strong>Changing Opinions</strong>: You also pointed out that people\u2019s opinions might have changed after the first round of voting. Ranked choice voting is significant for situations like this. It lets people express their preferences more accurately and adapt to the community\u2019s current needs. This keeps the grant decisions in tune with what the community wants.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>", "author": "Tenzent", "parent_post_title": "STIP - Round 1: Voting Period Update", "parent_post_id": 18725}, {"text": "<p>Hey <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/tnorm\">@tnorm</a> thank you for looking into our proposal.

Unfortunately this was just due to how TVL has changed over the last few months, but we would previously have sat in the largest category. Had this been the case, we certainly would have applied for even more incentives, because of the sheer number of Beefy users and products on Arbitrum, and the scope we therefore have to use this grant to develop the ecosystem. So ultimately we haven\u2019t changed our view of the incentives, we\u2019ve just changed our understanding of the expectations for these short-term incentives.</p>\n<p>The original 24 month suggestion was because if we could only access the maximum amount of grant funding one time, it would be preferable to adopt a longer period of time for distribution, to give more flexibility. What we hadn\u2019t appreciated was that the community intend for this to be distributed in the next few months <em>because</em> there will be more grants immediately after that. As such, we are very happy with the shorter timescale, and to come back later for other grants. We feel we can certainly put 2 million $ARB to use well in the next few months, with significant economies of scale due to the size of the funding.

Having keenly observed the trajectory of numerous DeFi platforms, it\u2019s evident that Vertex\u2019s approach and dedication are worth our attention.<br>\nVertex\u2019s unwavering commitment to Arbitrum, in particular, is a strategic move that\u2019s hard to overlook. Such dedication signals a deep belief in Arbitrum\u2019s potential and a long-term vision, distinguishing Vertex from many fleeting endeavors in this space.<br>\nRegarding the size of Vertex, it\u2019s pivotal to look beyond the present moment. Growth rate and potential often precede actual size, and by that metric, Vertex is on a commendable trajectory. The pace at which they have scaled, even in a crowded ecosystem, is indicative of their innovation and market resonance.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, when discussing longevity in the volatile DeFi space, it\u2019s essential to consider the underpinnings of a project.

Vertex\u2019s potential for growth and the innovation they promise could be invaluable assets to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Furthermore, a pertinent observation in the current DeFi landscape is the ephemeral nature of many projects. It\u2019s an unfortunate reality that a significant number of these platforms, despite their initial promise, may not survive the test of time. This underscores the importance of strategic incentivization. Rather than distributing resources thinly across a plethora of projects, it might be more judicious to focus on protocols that display tangible potential and resilience, such as Vertex.

We are in the business of creating tangible value, not mere online influence. Our focus is predominantly on substantial institutional players, with an emphasis on family offices in this current environment.

These updates illuminate the unwavering support we\u2019ve received from core community members like the D2 Rangers and D2 Hunters, especially during trying times. A testament to this commitment is our impressive staking ratio of around 70% of the net supply. For a deeper understanding, you can refer to <a href=\"https://debank.com/protocols/arb_d2\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeBank | The Web3 Messenger &amp; Best Web3 Portfolio Tracker</a></li>\n<li><strong>Engagement Outside of Discord</strong>: We recognize that not everyone has the luxury of time to stay active on platforms like Discord throughout the day. Our approach has always been about quality over quantity. We have been making significant efforts to engage with potential allocators through our existing network in TradFi. This community, which highly respects and trusts Luca\u2019s reputation as a leading derivatives trader in Asia, has traditionally been hesitant towards Crypto and DeFi. However, the proposed incentives aim to bridge this gap and encourage people take the opportunity in more serios considerations.</li>\n<li><strong>Objective of the $10M Vault</strong>: The figure might seem substantial in the context of DeFi, but in comparison to the potential of our existing contacts in TradFi, it is a relatively modest amount. We believe it provides a feasible starting point to integrate these entities into the world of DeFi.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Liquidity</strong>: We are fully aware of the importance of robust options liquidity for the success of our proposal. To that end, we rely on established protocols such as Lyra, Rysk, and Dopex to ensure the necessary liquidity is available. Supporting proposals that aim to incentivize Options Liquidity is in line with our vision and strategy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In conclusion, we understand your concerns and appreciate the opportunity to provide clarity.

Therefore, our grant allocation is directed towards lenders, not LP leverage users. Borrowers (i.e. LP users) won\u2019t receive double ARB rewards from both the underlying Perp DEX and Vaultka because our focus is on lenders who do not receive ARB incentives from other protocols.

These protocols will be determined based on the Defi Llama Derivatives Category, which is illustrated in the image below (Please note that the list is subject to change and will be confirmed once the proposal is passed). Specifically, at the end date of this campaign, we will retrieve lists of wallet addresses from the deposit events within each Perp DEX LP smart contract to compile a record of interacting addresses.

The ratio between CHOKE &amp; tCHOKE is crucial for Omnipools overall health. On the other hand, ARB allocation will be used to incentivize new liquidity providers that will help make Artichoke\u2019s Omnipool Ecosystem more robust. <strong>Documentation will help understand in detail.</strong></p>\n<p>(3) As stated on <strong>Execution Strategy</strong>, partners are crucial for Artichoke\u2019s Omnipool as well.

Let us address them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We have adjusted the requested grant amount down to <strong>750k ARB</strong> to be more in line with the recommended metrics of being live on Arbitrum for 4 months (The baseline performance is kept unchanged.) Also, given the 2x+ over subscription of the allocated 50Mn ARB by applicants, we think the reduced amount should make our application more appealing and reasonable to delegates. Please note that the rewards to be given out in each  tier has also been updated accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We believe our distribution mechanism, as originally proposed, is already well designed. Awarding bonus points to esHMX and DPs stakers are giving extra incentives to loyal traders over mercenary traders which is precisely what we want to achieve. As esHMX are given out to traders, how much esHMX staked acts as a proxy on how much users have traded over time and should be rewarded for their repeated use. In addition, as the rewards will be distributed over a period of 12 weeks, even users who are new to the HMX platform will have the ability to accumulate both esHMX and DPs through trading (as esHMX is awarded through usage of the protocol), allowing them to capture a larger share of the incentives over time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In terms of the benefits to other protocols on Arbitrum, we have to first appreciate that depending on the segment / functionalities of each protocol, some will naturally be more geared towards integration - e.g. launchpad, aggregator, etc., while others are more geared towards building internal features - e.g. base layer protocols. That being said, our current distribution method will benefit the protocols that build on top of us a  trading activity naturally contributes to other aspects of the protocol. Trading generates revenue for the protocol, which is subsequently distributed to HLP depositors and stakers. Consequently, our partner protocols, built on top of HMX, will receive second-order benefits from our grant usage:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pendle</strong>: With higher HLP yields, which is a function of trading activities on HMX, our HLP pool on Pendle will be more attractive for users to trade on principle vs. yields, attracting more users to Pendle in the process.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Penpie &amp; Equilibria</strong>: Both protocols are built on top of Pendle and have listed HLP for staking. Similar to Pendle, these protocols are the natural beneficiaries of the increased HLP yields, attracting more users to them in the process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stella</strong>: As some portion of the protocol revenue goes towards the staked HMX, users can expect more price action on the token as revenue goes up, from an increase in trading vol. This will enhance the appeal of leveraged yield farming through Stella\u2019s farming feature on the HMX-ETH pool, increasing the usage of Stella.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>We have added as an additional condition that the ARB incentives amount distributed in a given week will not exceed the protocol revenue earned on the same week.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We have made the adjustment in the original proposal accordingly.</p>", "author": "HMX", "parent_post_title": "[HMX][FINAL][STIP-Round1]", "parent_post_id": 17518}, {"text": "<p>Post has been marked as FINAL and locked.</p>", "author": "cliffton.eth", "parent_post_title": "[HMX][FINAL][STIP-Round1]", "parent_post_id": 17518}, {"text": "<p>Thank you for the feedback Matt.<br>\nEdited.</p>", "author": "cvi.finance", "parent_post_title": "[CVI] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]", "parent_post_id": 17024}, {"text": "<p>Post has been marked FINAL and locked.</p>", "author": "cliffton.eth", "parent_post_title": "[CVI] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]", "parent_post_id": 17024}, {"text": "<p>Contract has been added as requested <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=12\" title=\":+1:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":+1:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>", "author": "Smashe", "parent_post_title": "[Tales of Elleria] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]", "parent_post_id": 17285}, {"text": "<p>This is exactly what we are working on currently, with a goal to make it as easy as possible to just swap/add liquidity outside of the gamified part.</p>\n<p>Thank you sir!</p>", "author": "TheTrueLeonidas", "parent_post_title": "[SpartaDEX] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]", "parent_post_id": 16709}, {"text": "<p>Currently we\u2019re Top 30 in terms of TVL on Arbitrum, according to DefiLlama, and Top 7 if we count DEXes only, with a TVL of more than $10 million.

We have watched Arbitrum secure the DeFi landscape but fall behind in the NFT space and this is what we would like to change.</p>\n<p>That is likely because it is a very young protocol! We have just published our public Dune Analytics Dashboard - Accessible <a href=\"https://dune.com/nftearth/nftearth-analytics\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>, which shows 20 unique addresses (as of this moment) that have staked NFTE which just launched this week. On average we have seen 1-5 transactions/per day in the Fortune application (Similar onchain game using Chainlink VRF from LooksRare except built by us on Arbitrum). We have averaged around 10 marketplace transactions as well - and the LayerZero OFT token is traded, NFTE, (view on <a href=\"https://dexscreener.com/arbitrum/0x17ee09e7a2cc98b0b053b389a162fc86a67b9407\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DexScreener</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nftearth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CoinGecko</a>) on average around 75 trades/day.</p>\n<p>Also be sure to check out the staking profile that <a href=\"https://debank.com/protocols/arb_nftearth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeBank</a> has just added to their web3 portfolio tracker, which is the NFTEarth Staking program, xNFTE - this is in essence a modified version of veBAL and a huge component of what differentiates our platform vs. any other in existence.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned in comparison to even the largest protocols in existence users in the NFT space have to a large extent disappeared and this is what we can change.

(You can currently trade on NFTEarth in 3 currencies: ETH, NFTE, ARB) and by incentivizing ARB, this is a net positive effect for the token of the entire ecosystem, so we believe this is a great place to begin and then evaluate how effective it is at getting traction. We plan to allocate a fixed % of the grant to this bucket, and for users to earn their share of this incentive pro-rata to the overall volume traded per week/Epoch, which we will then make claimable via Merkle distribution or direct airdrop to user addresses. So, we will filter the Seaport contract activity (what we currently use as our primary marketplace contract) for all trades in ARB currency <code>0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548</code> and then share results accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Next, we have deployed the first onchain game on Arbitrum that uses Chainlink VRF to determine the game winners in a fair and transparent manner, called Fortune, and we believe this could spark significant activity on Arbitrum. This is our in-app game Fortune, at contract address <code>0xB11eD4D3b3D8Ace516Ceae0a8D4764BbF2B08c50</code> and it is modeled after the game LooksRare has deployed on Mainnet called YOLO. It\u2019s fun and engaging, gamified with music and sound effects, a fun graphical animation, and enhanced with user capabilities for gamers to chat real-time during game rounds. Overall we think a great way to get activity moving in the NFT space. Users can enter rounds with NFTs, ETH, NFTE, and ARB, with the value of the NFT entered with calculated based on the floor price oracle at <code>0xAeB1D03929bF87F69888f381e73FBf75753d75AF</code> provided by Reservoir Tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Next, we have deployed an onchain raffle game to Arbitrum, which we have also modeled after the raffle the LooksRare team deployed on Mainnet, and is at contract address <code>0xC597E0eC62b44feB0eF3bb59B374003d51E571C9</code> that we would intend to reward users of the platform with in ARB incentives as part of an on-going raffle for platform participation every ~12 hours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Last, is our new voting incentive mechanism developed as part of the NFTEarth Staking Rewards Program. We have deployed a mechanism called xNFTE, which is in large part based on the veBAL system, where in partnership with Gamma Strategies, we enable users to create a fungible UniswapV3 LP position that can be staked to acquire voting power through xNFTE (xNFTE is what represents value accrual and voting power for NFTEarth). As many DeFi protocols (Curve, Convex, Balancer, etc.) hold weekly gauge votes for incentives, we now have the same infrastructure in place onchain to do this in the NFT realm, but instead of incentivizing an LP pair, it will be an <strong>NFT collection</strong> (or some other behavior ie., mints, collection creation, or other TBD) - and voters can exercise their voting power gained from being stakers in the NFTEarth ecosystem; to vote on our <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/nftearthl2.eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snapshot</a> Space in the weekly incentives vote to direct incentives. We foresee this being used not only by the DAO to help direct emissions of the NFTE token, but also enable a means for any protocol or individual to - in a permissionless fashion - create incentives for an NFT that they would like to mint or promote trading of, and can then provide the incentives to do so for. The <code>FeeDistributor</code> contract for rewards to be deposited to and for all stakers to claim from on a weekly basis is at <code>0x9138A2e628f92a42397B3B600E86047AE49aCa98</code> and this is where these incentives would be sent to.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The final onchain component is what we have spent the most time designing for how we would like to primarily use this batch of STIP - and then build this into a long-term and sustainable incentive program, by <strong>gamifying the entire system</strong> - is by using our Arbitrum marketplace in conjunction with each user profile tied to the onchain wallet address the user has linked to their NFTEarth profile, in order to accumulate points in a leaderboard and game system, <strong>where XP is accrued</strong> for the onchain actions desired.</p>\n<p>This would be similar to the enormously successful campaign Blur ran on Mainnet last year, except <strong>completely optimized</strong> for Arbitrum - where users are incentivized to conduct many actions onchain, and are rewarded correspondingly. For example, list NFTs = XP points, make offers = XP points, place trades = XP points. And then some examples to further refine this, special caveats as well, such as if the user is an xNFTE staker (meaning long-term supporter of the protocol and by extension the Arbitrum ecosystem = boost in XP points, if they trade in ARB = another boost in XP points. We would have <code>Seasons</code> and display a page in the app called Leaderboard that much like Blur\u2019s leaderboard, or GMX\u2019s top traders dashboard, shows the current results, and also resets every 24 hours and keeps track of total XP points accumulated by each address throughout the season. This gamified system of incentives is what we are most excited about building and what we believe holds the greatest potential to genuinely turn Arbitrum into the unquestionable L2 NFT leader, and we can\u2019t wait to build it!</p>\n<p>Warm regards,</p>\n<p>NFTEarth Team</p>", "author": "NFTEarth", "parent_post_title": "[NFTEarth] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]", "parent_post_id": 16688}, {"text": "<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/nftearth\">@NFTEarth</a> Thank you for these added details and clarity.

We\u2019d like to elaborate on our reasons given above. Two main things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our growth increases derivatives activity on Arbitrum</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ApolloX partnered PancakeSwap to launch our version 2 on-chain perp trading on Arbitrum. The grant, if accepted, would be used as trading and LP incentives for v2. On BNB Chain, we come up top for derivatives TVL, while PancakeSwap tops DeFi TVL. Both platforms are also arguably the most widely-known and used in the BSC derivatives and defi sectors. This is an opportunity to introduce BNB Chain users to Arbitrum, tapping into both APX\u2019s and PCS\u2019s user bases. However, users require a push factor to move to another chain or even try out perpetual trading. The incentives would help them take the first step.</p>\n<p>We believe our current performance on BNB Chain would be surpassed with Arbitrum\u2019s mature derivatives ecosystem. Our growth on Arbitrum ultimately contributes to overall transaction activity and TVL on Arbitrum itself. As ApolloX grows, other protocols on Arbitrum would also build upon us to introduce their own products, further expanding Arbitrum activity.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Our presence supports derivatives innovation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ApolloX offers competitive product features. For example, no other prominent perp DEX offers 750x leverage for crypto perps. We have seen great trading interest for such high-leverage products. In fact, since our launch on Arbitrum, the 750x leverage contracts dominate trading activity on our platform.

I would like to emphasise to readers that we have made a geniune attempt to use real data to make costings for our proposal. By using data taken from historical partner behaviour and other protocols with similar programmes, we have been able to ask for the least amount of ARB possible to fulfill our goals whilst acheiving the maximum intended impact.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure about what you mean about artificial revenue. Couldn\u2019t that be framed for any emissions or governance token like ARB or the entire STIP itself? With respect to clawback of deposited bribes it is highly likely that veCHR voters will vote for CL pools to gain the ARB revenue that is on offer and will significantly dilute our clawback. Chronos is not asking for protocols to recycle all of their bribes (100% recycling is only applicable to the 50,000 ARB we requested to bribe ecosystem CL pools; and we expect this to exhaust). For reference we have historically seen a 15-30% clawback rate for protocols and are requesting that protocols maintain a 50% recycling rate for clawbacked ARB. Thus, the majority of ARB will go to Arbitrum users. We think that the highly efficient nature of a bribe for emissions model is a good thing, this brings more real revenue for Arbitrum users and as seen across different protocols is more cost efficient and sustainable than streaming out emissions.</p>\n<p>We also think that not recycling all ARB is important beyond fulfilling the STIP emissions schedule. We want to use Chronos TAG to onboard the next generation of Arbitrum protocols. For this, it is important for protocols to be able to grow governance power and they can use ARB in positive sum ways for their own ecosystem. Therefore, we aim for Chronos TAG to be a supportive hub that will give smaller Arbitrum native projects the best chance at succeeding on the network.</p>\n<p>A better framework would be to ask how much value has each ARB spent generated? At the end of the day, the proposals that bring the most sticky users/protocols, revenue and fees for each $ spent will be the most effecitive and worth funding over a longer timeframe, not those that can just provide incentives at the required rate. No one really knows how this will go for approved proposals, but we are backing ourselves and are designing a dashboard to measure the impact that Chronos will generate for each $ of ARB spent.</p>\n<p>In any case, the overall outcome of our recycling strategy for core ecosystem CL pools is increasing and consistent CHR emissions revenue for Arbitrum LPs that will deepen liquidity and fulfills the STIP objectives. Furthermore, should Arbitrum users see the value of doing so, they can lock CHR to gain this revenue and be additionally rewarded for doing so (with veCHR and ARB) through Chronos TAG. The more that do this, the more revenue Arbitrum users can earn and the more value protocols will see in depositing more bribes; a win-win.</p>\n<p>In the unlikely event that ARB is leftover after the grant schedule, we don\u2019t have a strong opinion and are open to discussions. We have included a specific paragraph in this proposal that states if the ARB we are getting is too high, we are happy to reduce it and will be assesed every 2 weeks. This should be sufficient to ensure accurate streaming of funds. With a more long-term view for the ecosystem, it seems more sensibile to let protocols who are committed to providing revenue for Arbitrum users to drive liquidity to continue distributing incentives after the term is over.</p>", "author": "Telaga", "parent_post_title": "[Chronos Finance] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]", "parent_post_id": 17035}, {"text": "<p>Chronos is not perfect at this time, there are many issues that need to be resolved.

To clarify, liquidity is indirectly deepened through increasing emissions that will attract more LPs to core ecosystem pools. This occurs by users voting for these pools (to direct emissions to them) because ARB bribe revenue will be on offer for them to receive.</p>\n<p>Historically, we have used our treasury voting power to direct a significant amount of emissions to ecosystem pools to drive their liquidity. We expect our voting share to be significantly reduced due to the ARB on offer (so most ARB will go to voting users), also any ARB that is clawed back as a result of our votes are 100% sent back into those pools and not farmed. The strength of this is that the ecosystem pools will receive much more votes and therefore emissions for LPs as Chronos and users will be voting on the pools. By Chronos recycling the bribes, this will have a cumulative effect on bribes and therefore emissions and liquidity depth.</p>\n<p>I could see two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In our bi-weekly report, we can confirm the re-direction of all clawed back ARB into the ecosystem pools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We can amend this so that no treasury voting power can be used to vote on pools with ARB bribes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Depending on your thoughts, could you clarify how the Ramses approval has gone ahead given that they have communicated that team/treasury wallets will be participating in voting (and therefore farming)?

There definitely needs to be a lot of scrutiny for all proposals, which I see you agree with. That being said, there are a few points that are not correct from what you mentioned in your comments.</p>\n<p>Firstly, MAI is not \u201cseverely under-collaterized\u201d. It should also be noted that MAI has a Chain Risk strategy that prevents too much MAI from entering certain chains. If you have any concerns about QiDao\u2019s deployments on other chains, then this should help ease those. You can read more about that here: <a href=\"https://docs.mai.finance/risks/chain-risk\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chain Risk - Mai Finance</a>. Arbitrum has currently reached its limit for new MAI being bridged into it. As such it\u2019s in a sort of isolated state from other chains. If it were to alleviate your concerns, QiDao could look to isolate its Arbitrum deployment similarly to how it did with Base. You can see on Defillama and Aerodrome the great success QiDao has achieved there.</p>\n<p>The use of the grant, as outlined above, is to promote the native minting of stablecoins on Arbitrum with assets that are value-add to the ecosystem, such as ARB, gDAI, LP tokens, and various LSTs. This is incredibly important for Arbitrum so that the community isnt just farmed from the outside by bridged stablecoins.</p>\n<p>If you have reserved thoughts / biases towards MAI, that should be disclosed. Impartiality in DAO decisions is incredibly important.</p>\n<p>When it comes to Arbitrum as an ecosystem, QiDao has been a strong partner of most projects. From the bluechip projects like Balancer, Kyber, and Curve, to newer projects like Chronos, and Ramses, QiDao has played at active role in the ecosystem.

We deeply appreciate your feedback, as it allows us to refine our application to align more closely with broader interests.</p>\n<p>While it may seem that Magpie\u2019s primary aim is to amplify the yield on the base layer, our focus diverges from just that. Our main goal isn\u2019t to merely append an additional yield. Instead, we\u2019ve allocated 80% of our incentive towards blackholing PENDLE/GRAIL/dLP/WOM to support the sustainable growth of the underlying protocols. We believe that incentivizing users to make permanent commitments, by locking their tokens, will create a lasting positive impact on the ecosystem, even after the ARB incentive period has concluded. Such a strategy, might be more enduring than offering short term incentives on the base layer, which might only attract transient liquidity providers. Addressing your concerns about the grant amount, we acknowledge the shared sentiment regarding its size. To provide more clarity, while the cumulative grant amount may appear substantial, it is designated to fund multiple initiatives. Our dedicated team of approximately 30 members is concurrently building several projects. When this grant is apportioned across the four individual projects we\u2019re focusing on, each project receives a proportionally smaller amount. Bearing this in mind, we\u2019re receptive to modifications and are considering feedback like yours to adjust our proposal. Suggestions on a suitable grant size would be invaluable as we aim to strike a balance that is mutually beneficial for both Magpie and the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Without liquidity mining rewards this product would not attract any LPs.</p>\n<p>Arrakis V2- The second iteration of the Arrakis Market Making infrastructure, which allows real market making strategies to be run with multi LP position, Multi fee tier LPing and more. Arrakis V2 exists in a private vault setting and public vault setting.<br>\nArrakis V2 Private Vault Setting - Curently has the PALM product built on top which launched in Jan 2023 and requires no liquidity mining incentives, and purely is a product for protocols POL.<br>\nArrakis V2 Public Vault Setting - The first and current only product on top of this is the LST Vaults deployed as mentioned a few weeks ago. In order to attract capital it requires liquidity mining incentives.</p>\n<p>Considering that Arrakis has not had a token (yet <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/eyes.png?v=12\" title=\":eyes:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":eyes:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">) only external liquidity mining incentives brought TVL, in the V1 this was mainly still happening on Mainnet as this is where most protocols still wanted their liquidity. As of June 2022 we did not really focus on growth and maintenance for the V1 product as we were heavily working on Arrakis V2. As mentioned above we are working with protocols on Arbitrum that are using PALM, since this is focussed on POL, TVL is not the right KPI to look at.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Jadmat\" data-post=\"9\" data-topic=\"16565\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/jadmat/48/3401_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Jadmat:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You have KPIs from the result of the grant received by Lido</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase volume to the wsteth/usdc pool</li>\n<li>Decrease price impact and overall have better price execution</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We started the Lido LST Vaults on September 9th, and as you can see here volume has shot up ever since, also on the price impact side the strategy is working extremely well.</p>\n<p>You can see how these are currently doing here:<br>\nhttps ://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x4622df6fb2d9bee0dcdacf545acdb6a2b2f4f863<br>\nPool Price Impact - <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3018010/5013287?number_of_days_n26d66=3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://dune.com/queries/3018010/5013287?number_of_days_n26d66=3</a><br>\nPool Performance Overview - <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3017629/5021682?number_of_days_n26d66=30&amp;pool_e15077=UniV3+USDC%3AwstETH+0.05+Ethereum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://dune.com/queries/3017629/5021682?number_of_days_n26d66=30&amp;pool_e15077=UniV3+USDC%3AwstETH+0.05+Ethereum</a></p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Jadmat\" data-post=\"9\" data-topic=\"16565\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/jadmat/48/3401_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Jadmat:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you have comparative metrics regarding TVL and Volume of LST in other chains, which compare the performance of Arrakis vs other dexes</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Currently LST Vaults are active on Mainnet from Lido, and on Arbitrum, the ones on Arbitrum however are incentivized with a very small amount of $ARB via Merkl, due to the LST Vault strategy Arrakis is providing the best APR here though.<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/ec2ede52b049968acdf4a1bd1afec8d849307d40.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xHn65xsPRwM2wTxpN5zOTLOwgJq.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/ec2ede52b049968acdf4a1bd1afec8d849307d40.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"xHn65xsPRwM2wTxpN5zOTLOwgJq\" width=\"690\" height=\"290\" data-dominant-color=\"474C6B\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">732\u00d7308 35.5 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>On Arbitrum what you can see is that the WSTETH/ETH pool on Uniswap is taking all the volume, Curve and Camelot facilitates pretty much no volume.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Jadmat\" data-post=\"9\" data-topic=\"16565\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/jadmat/48/3401_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Jadmat:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regarding</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>A proposal is being put up right now with Frax, as well as discussions are ongoing with Lido and the other LST providers.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Jadmat\" data-post=\"9\" data-topic=\"16565\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/jadmat/48/3401_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Jadmat:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a final point, the request is equivalent to 80% of the tvl that Arrakis has in Arbitrum</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>This is correct, we want to grow on Arbitrum, further more we want to get people to move their LSTs from other networks to Arbitrum, and have them be active in the Arbitrum space.

Let me explain. While we originally launched as a DEX over 2.5 years ago, ApeSwap has not been focused on building a DEX for over a year. This is largely due to our bonds quickly becoming our bread and butter, and us slowly shifting our focus and resources away from the DEX as a whole. This has been made especially over the past couple of months. While our DEX page is still live, you\u2019ll notice that we are now leveraging LiFi\u2019s tech to route swaps across multiple chains, effectively moving us completely away from our own liquidity and running our own DEX. While we still support swaps, we are fully focused on providing bonds.</p>\n<p>Now why are TVL and Volume irrelevant? These are not great metrics to track bonds with as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no TVL with our bonds offering</li>\n<li>Volume works differently than trading volume, and therefore wouldn\u2019t make sense to compare</li>\n</ul>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group quote-modified\" data-username=\"flindy\" data-post=\"4\" data-topic=\"17365\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/f/edb3f5/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> flindy:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"ApeSwap\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"17365\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/apeswap/48/3430_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> ApeBond:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For the adept management of this initiative, ApeSwap will impose a 5% initiation fee on the net bonded value.

In light of this feedback, we would like to add some more context about what we\u2019re building and make some changes to our plan for $ARB distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Our new plan is to offer rebates on swap fees</strong> as an incentive to try out the Shell app, where users can execute any set of trades or DeFi operations in one transaction. This will accompany a big marketing push that coincides with TGE, third party protocol integrations via the Adapter primitive, the launch of new Evolving Proteus pools, and a revamped frontend for the Shell app.</p>\n<p>Alongside these 4 milestones, our approach of reimbursing fees will help bring users to Shell, and therefore to Arbitrum. <strong>It will grow not just Shell\u2019s volume but also the volume of any third party protocols that users interact with through the Shell app.</strong></p>\n<p>Our vision is for Shell Protocol to be the frontend of DeFi. Currently there is no single place on Arbitrum where a user can access every single DeFi protocol and make complex financial operations in one click. Shell can fill this vacuum. It is an app that can handle any set of user operations in DeFi in one atomic transaction.</p>\n<p>Shell\u2019s architecture enables atomic n-to-m swaps. It can currently handle any token including NFTs and LP tokens, meaning users can combine any type of swap with providing/withdrawing liquidity, among other things. At the time of TGE or soon after, these swaps will be able to go through any third party AMM as well as include DeFi operations involving other third party DeFi protocols like lending pools, NFT markets, and more. This will be possible through the new Adapter primitive.</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Breakdown:</strong> 100% of the funds will be used to reimburse swap fees on any trade that goes through Shell Protocol.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"MMYes\" data-post=\"8\" data-topic=\"17517\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/919ad9/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> MMYes:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After assessing your proposal the execution strategy is unclear, making it hard to truly justify the grant request size based on lack of understanding of how it can be put to use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p><strong>Execution Strategy:</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s important that rebates are high enough to encourage users, but not so high as to generate wash trading. Every swap has two cost sources: gas and DEX fees. The goal is for the rebate to cover ~85% of the gas costs and DEX fees.</p>\n<p>Rebates will be calculated off-chain, which will allow potential wash trades (if any) to be filtered out of the pool of eligible trades. An off-chain implementation will also allow price APIs, such as CoinGecko, to be used to calculate the proper reward. Periodically, at the end of each month during the promotional period, rebates will be distributed to users.</p>\n<p>If the program is effective at growing the Shell ecosystem, volume will increase and we will supplement the rebates with $SHELL tokens. If the program is not effective, there will be more $ARB than needed for rebates, and we will return any remaining $ARB to the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Matching:</strong></p>\n<p>Half of the dollar value of the rebates will come from $SHELL tokens, the other half of the rebate value will come from $ARB tokens.</p>\n<p>If the grant is effective, volume will increase and we will hit our metrics. If we blow past our targets, then we can continue the rebate program but using 100% $SHELL instead. On the other hand, if the total cost of rebates within a tranche is lower than the amount of $ARB allotted to that tranche, the remaining $ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n<p>If the grant is not effective, and we don\u2019t hit our metrics, the Arbitrum DAO will get its money back.

Each one is running the taker script, which tracks all the created limit orders, and if an order identified is profitable, the market makers will compete against each other for fulfillment. The first market maker to fulfill the order will then be able to send a message to unlock the assets on the source chain, therefore earning a spread. This is also what enables the near-instant settlement component of DLN.

One example could be as follows:</p>\n<p>First ringfence funds through a vote, without providing unilateral control to a particular committee or even moving the funds. Make this a green light, to approve the structure of the program considered.</p>\n<p>A small portion of those funds could be set aside in a multisg for operations to fund reviews by a due diligence committee (e.g. 1000 ARB for 5 people to review for 2 hours). Proposals must then meet pre-determined criteria to qualify for a review. The initial hard work goes into the template and basic gatekeeping. The high bar for applicants elicits a better signal to noise.</p>\n<p>These proposals could be reviewed by the committee, if it meets certain criteria it can be approved to go to vote. Approved proposals could then be bundled and voted on as a set or individual on some cadence that is not burdensome to governance. Once you have the first round of successful projects, you fund the multisig in accordance with defined operating procedures.</p>\n<p>Proposals only 500k ARB or above could be considered to start, this means either you get people investing the work upfront with the appropriate talent, or not. With a high floor you reduce the number of applicants and reviews are easier.</p>\n<p>Regardless, there are plenty of solid ways to structure something like this, but it requires work and time.

I think thats where the research grant can really shine for us though. We tried to setup those buckets to line up with some of the gaps we foresee in the formula, that way we can answer as much as possible on the formula and fund research to start figuring out a sound way to quantify the rest.</p>\n<p>I also hear you on fact-checking and this is something that I have been going back and forth on a lot. Im a huge believer of confirming data so I don\u2019t see how we can avoid this.

However, I believe there will be some shared learning, AIP-3 is more of a shotgun type of allocation of small grants, whereas the Roundtable will be larger allocations to established projects building on Arbitrum. The Roundtable will target larger research projects like shared standardization or cross-project margin. Ecosystem level bug bounties, auditing agreements, or marketing campaigns.

The Roundtable will focus more on established projects and shall act as the spiritual successor to STIP.</p>\n<p>The Roundtable will be made of 9 Arbitrum Projects - Their appointed Steward, and their communities. The Steward\u2019s focus will to establish the procedures to request larger ticket grants, what those grants can be spent on, to help coordinate on shared research, resources, or costs.  They should have communities to lean on for example Treasures ARC program, the Premia Parliament, GMX Blueberry Club, etc. As a Steward it will be important to gather their community\u2019s interest when passing a vote on any contested decision.</p>\n<p>The support group will be specific service providers that carry out unique tasks or responsibilities on behalf of the Roundtable.  This could be onboarding approved third-party vendors that grant spend can be used on, to create research reports on the most effective grants, to monitor approved grants for compliance, etc.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6c35122ea1bfb5d1c5fef143bbceda8e11a9b526.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/frfgNxIigtzfOs0jkCQPy0SqUQu.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"SpecOps Roundtable\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6c35122ea1bfb5d1c5fef143bbceda8e11a9b526_2_690x458.jpeg\" alt=\"SpecOps Roundtable\" data-base62-sha1=\"frfgNxIigtzfOs0jkCQPy0SqUQu\" width=\"690\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6c35122ea1bfb5d1c5fef143bbceda8e11a9b526_2_690x458.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6c35122ea1bfb5d1c5fef143bbceda8e11a9b526_2_1035x687.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6c35122ea1bfb5d1c5fef143bbceda8e11a9b526.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"485074\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">SpecOps Roundtable</span><span class=\"informations\">1200\u00d7798 156 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"englandzz\" data-post=\"4\" data-topic=\"19101\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/englandzz/48/4817_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> englandzz:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>what mechanisms will be in place to ensure transparency and community involvement?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>The Calls of the Roundtable will be recorded or even streamed if there is interest to ensure nothing is hidden, any contested decision that would require a vote by the roundtable would be done on an Arbitrum subspace so the Arbitrum DAO could see how each steward is voting as well as for what reason.

Both issuers and recipients have feature-complete platforms to track and manage grants.</li>\n<li>Hedgey also allows for the ability to distribute grants via stream. These grants can be both revocable or non-revocable, pay out in continuous streams(every second) or periodically (weekly, monthly,) and include hyper-customized features in grant creation. New grants cost pennies to create and can be created individually or up to 40 in a single transaction.</li>\n<li>Hedgey allows grant issuers to optionally create and share public dashboards where an entire grant program can be shared with the broader DAO. <a href=\"https://app.hedgey.finance/treasury-lockups/public/arbitrum/0x8ea7275c4fe3ccbe9cab50352b915144d860a947394a6005dc7a2fc76a1522ee\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Here</a> is a demo public dashboard featuring Arbitrum.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Unique reasons to use Hedgey for grants</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hedgey Grants can be set as transferable, non-transferable, and transferable-by-admin. Our approach to grants allows DAOs to restrict how grants can move and restrict them from being sold.</li>\n<li>Hedgey is completely free with no fee switch.</li>\n<li>Hedgey allows grant issuers to (optionally) add onchain governance rights to locked/vesting token grants. Should Arbitrum want grant recipients to participate in governance with their grants, they will be able to allow it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Total Cost</strong><br>\nHedgey is a 100% free public good. There are no fees and there is no fee switch.</p>\n<p><strong>Security</strong><br>\nHedgey is <a href=\"https://github.com/hedgey-finance/Locked_VestingTokenPlans/blob/master/audit/hedgey-token-plans-audit-2023-06.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audited by Consensys Diligence</a>. We are trusted by incredible orgs like Gitcoin, Celo, IndexCoop, Shapeshift and 50+ other DAOs with over 6000 streams/lockups.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>\nHedgey has been a long time supporter of Arbitrum and is mission driven to help more DAOs grow and prosper by supporting your grants program. As the teams mentioned above will vouch for, we will go hands-on, above and beyond to create an incredible experience for the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem and continue building out the products and features to make the grants program on Arbitrum incredible for everyone.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your consideration and support.</p>\n<p>Technicals</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Links: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hedgeyfinance\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://hedgey.finance\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Website</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hedgey-finance/Locked_VestingTokenPlans\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Github</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hedgey-finance/Locked_VestingTokenPlans/blob/master/audit/hedgey-token-plans-audit-2023-06.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Audit</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Control: Hedgey smart contracts are completely decentralized and intentionally not upgradable.

As far as where this proposal is in its current state, it doesn\u2019t seem to sufficiently outline the details behind who will be distributed the stated $ARB rewards. Since there seems to be a cap of 25 recipients, it would be best to first outline those names explicitly for transparency purposes BEFORE going forward with a vote. This isn\u2019t necessarily for the community to judge the selected individuals, it\u2019s merely to track who is being rewarded prior to voting. It is also unclear what metrics exactly are used to determine the top 25 candidates and if 25 is in fact the optimal number. We are in favor of the spirit of this proposal and hope to enable more contributor-based reward programs in the future, but a more systematic approach at designing this initiative would, in our view, make it more compelling.

Since nothing of this magnitude has previously been conducted across any DAO, it was difficult to decide how much capital should be allotted to this type of program. We, along with many others, were surprised by the number of proposals. One can argue that the 50M allotment was anticipated for a smaller number of participants, and now, back funding is our way to compensate for the unprecedented number of successful applications.</p>\n<p>Another consideration is recognizing that the most well known protocols attracted the most voting power. This is in part due to heuristic voting\u2013people just vote for entities that they\u2019re familiar with. Another factor is network\u2013larger protocols typically have more sway over the decision-making of delegates. Since not all delegates made it a priority to help fund up-and-coming protocols, back funding those smaller projects seems reasonable.</p>\n<p>Plus, it\u2019s too soon to conduct a round two of STIPs. The next best step would be to observe and analyze the efficacy of the current STIP round. We don\u2019t want to go through another round of voting so soon for the protocols who didn\u2019t make the cut.

These changes are crucial for maintaining a modern and efficient blockchain infrastructure.</p>\n<p>A notable aspect of the proposal is the refinement of fee structures, particularly regarding retryable transactions. The distinction between the network fee account and the infrastructure fee account suggests a more nuanced approach to fee management, which could lead to fairer and more efficient transaction processing. Furthermore, improvements in precompile methods, like preventing certain methods from consuming all gas upon reverting, create better resource management and efficiency. These adjustments are important for both developers and users, as they contribute to a more user-friendly and cost-effective environment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>", "author": "juanbug", "parent_post_title": "Uniswap-Arbitrum Delegate Program (UADP) Communication Thread", "parent_post_id": 19225}, {"text": "<h3><a name=\"constitutional-aip-security-council-improvement-proposalhttpssnapshotorgarbitrumfoundationethproposal0xc591f79422bf26faf13055df098142569785c04316fdae5be993e282721eb717-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#constitutional-aip-security-council-improvement-proposalhttpssnapshotorgarbitrumfoundationethproposal0xc591f79422bf26faf13055df098142569785c04316fdae5be993e282721eb717-1\"></a><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc591f79422bf26faf13055df098142569785c04316fdae5be993e282721eb717\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal</a></h3>\n<p><strong>Vote: Increase the threshold to 9/12</strong><br>\n<strong>Type: Snapshot</strong></p>\n<p>We respect the L2Beat team\u2019s continual efforts to bring awareness towards the risks surrounding L2s as they continually mature.

This would allow the DAO to assess, deliberate and ultimately decide on each option independently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my initial drafting of this, my goal was to discuss the voting process on the whole and getting to a standardized guideline. As I added issues to illustrate why I think the overhaul was needed, it has sort of morphed into these three key issues. I do believe all three are worth addressing at once for simplicity and effectiveness, but I also don\u2019t want one controversial piece stop another popular item from passing. I\u2019m no way opposed to splitting this up (and upon further reflection this may be the way to go anyway). Maybe the process looks like 3 Snapshot temp checks, where then the passing items go to Tally all as 1 item however.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll add, there may be other best practices that can benefit the election process that I may not have addressed. So if other issues are present I have no issues expanding this out into a 4+ item discussion either.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For this reason, and to avoid the issues of \u201chow do we decide how to decide\u201d (a common pitfall when approving multi-option governance and voting changes) I would propose the following action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run a snapshot proposal where the DAO can provide it\u2019s feedback on whether it would like a standardised approach for election (1) OR leave the election process up to the discretion of the individual proposal writer (2)</li>\n<li>If the DAO is in favour of a standardised process (option 2), we can then run a follow up Snapshot detailing the different voting mechanisms the DAO could choose to select.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regardless, learning from the LTIPP \u201cself voting\u201d issues, going forward I think it is important for proposals to clearly articulate their election mechanism prior to starting the election process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is fair and I like the idea, and to your point earlier there are a lot of variables between the issues that may need multiple temp-check elections. The more I think about it the more I think this may be the cleaner option.</p>\n<p>A question back to you - I was struggling with this in terms of how to set a guideline without affecting flexibility proposal to proposal. However, I couldn\u2019t really see a scenario where say 95% of elections would be perfect for Weighted Voting, but there then is a specific use-case that is for Single Choice. Or the same with say Weighed vs Approval in a 2+ winning candidate election. Do you have thoughts on what I may be missing? I am all for allowing flexibility for situations we can\u2019t foresee, but I also don\u2019t want to create openness just for the sake of it\u2026 as the balancing act with this is always going to be that if we loosen the rails too much it opens us back up to the gamification issue.</p>\n<p>Maybe the play here is we define a specific voting type, but proposers can use a different voting type if and only if they clearly state that in the initial proposal discussion. Snaphot vote 1 is for the proposal, then in tandem a Snapshot vote 2 is up for approval for the ability to use a different voting method. That way delegates have a chance to block that voting style before the election occurs. I know it creates extra steps and I admittedly don\u2019t like how \u2018ugly\u2019 that is, but I\u2019d also rather have that option there in that edge use case where it really does make a difference\u2026 and in theory it would be only happening once in a blue moon anyway. Food for thought - <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/jojo\">@JoJo</a> tagging you as I saw you had a similar thought about allowing proposal writers to ask for another mechanism. I would agree it really should be a \u201899 out of 100\u2019 type thing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am strongly in support of the introduction of the \u201cShutter\u201d feature for the reasons articulated above. It would also have the added benefit of reducing the frequency of last minute tactical voting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From discussions had in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-changes-to-the-constitution-and-the-security-council-election-process/20856\">Security Council Election Thread</a> as well, it seems this will be the least controversial item. To your point above I\u2019d hate to see this specific item lost because one of the other issues can\u2019t be agreed upon. FWIW, I think this is the both the easiest thing to fix and conveniently probably causing the biggest issues regarding gamification of votes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ll need to reflect further on the specific mechanism. If the problem statement is \u201cseven days may not give high quality applications enough time to apply for council positions\u201d , reaching the minimum application threshold within seven days may still leave high quality applications without insufficient time to apply. For that reason we could propose an increased application window of 10 days. This could be combined with a minimum application count (N+2) with the voting rolling over by an additional week if the minimum application count is not reached within the initial 10 day period.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thank you for adding your thoughts on this one, as this one I spend the most thinking time on. I don\u2019t know if there really is a perfect answer here, so I too welcome anyone who is willing to input their thoughts into this. It\u2019s all about flexibility while still setting a \u2018floor\u2019 of minimum viable action. I personally have no issues with 10 days instead of 7. Again this is probably where your point of breaking up the votes shines as we can propose a few popular methodologies.</p>", "author": "Bob-Rossi", "parent_post_title": "RFC: Create a Standardized Guideline for Non-Security Council Elections", "parent_post_id": 20915}, {"text": "<p>I think this an excellent idea!</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group quote-modified\" data-username=\"Bob-Rossi\" data-post=\"4\" data-topic=\"20915\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/bob-rossi/48/873_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Bob-Rossi:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maybe the process looks like 3 Snapshot temp checks, where then the passing items go to Tally all as 1 item.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Part of my rational for this approach is that if pushed to vote now, I would opt for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FOR shutting voting (no brainer IMO)</li>\n<li>AGAINST fixed voting mechanism (as I think some optional flexibility in any system is good)</li>\n<li>ABSTAIN on Application Window and Application Count (though FOR on a 10 day application window increase)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Breaking it up feels important to me as if other delegates hold the same sentiment, it could lead to a rejection of shutter voting due to token holders disagreeing with a fixed voting mechanism.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Bob-Rossi\" data-post=\"4\" data-topic=\"20915\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/bob-rossi/48/873_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Bob-Rossi:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maybe the play here is we define a specific voting type, but proposers can use a different voting type if and only if they clearly state that in the initial proposal discussion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I support this proposal, but I suggest removing the parallel second snapshot vote.

That is a well-known issue with DAO\u2019s and governance models which only a few have adapted to prevent.</p>\n<p>I understand delegation already \u2013 I\u2019m a delegate and governance coordinator for another project, have been for a few years now.</p>\n<p>To put in simply;<br>\nOption <span class=\"hashtag\">#1</span> would be preferrable here as this mitigates \u2018vote-buying\u2019 and reduces circulating supply. Price does need to be sustained sufficiently otherwise it can undermine governance. Large whales can concentrate supply and thus voting power to influence direction, and without a locking criteria they\u2019re not exposed to the outcome of any proposal post-voting if they wish. This mean price can be manipulated through pulling liquidity and doing a mark down &gt; accumulate cheaper to grant more voting power &gt; dump after voting is done. In short, the DAO can be gamed by larger stake holders if you do not incentivize widespread distribution and timelock mechanisms.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not familiar with ve-token governance \u2013 it basically means you would take your ARB and timelock it for a fixed duration; the longer you lock for equates to the more voting power you gain, which decays over time closer to lock expiry. This ensures that those larger holders participating in governance voting, are also exposed to the outcome and result of the proposal - ergo \u201cskin in the game\u201d. If you don\u2019t do something like this, then the whole governance model can be easily undermined by vote-buying through escrow \u2013 that is, anyone from outside the community can temporarily have significant impact on voting without exposure to the outcome/result. Which means the door is wide-open for malicious governance attacks and exploitative proposals \u2013 yes, can use a veto council but that is not a decentralized process to solely depend on.</p>", "author": "cryptomickbit", "parent_post_title": "Burn/Fee/Lock mechanisms for ARB", "parent_post_id": 13597}, {"text": "<p>Its a very great ideal ride on am with you <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/v.png?v=12\" title=\":v:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":v:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/hugs.png?v=12\" title=\":hugs:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":hugs:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>", "author": "DonXcraft", "parent_post_title": "Grant Framework Design Contest!

In an ideal world, we would have multiple trustworthy and well thought outs program submissions and I would be all for your strategy. I just don\u2019t think this is the reality of it.

If we create a multitude of grants programs - I would highly suggest that each one specializes in a certain area similar to ENS (working groups) or Aave (AGD, Lens)</p>\n<p>If our main goal with these programs is decreasing voter apathy, I would highly suggest looking toward MakerDAO, that has a substantially higher percentage of the circ supply regularly vote.

It\u2019s interesting to note Guy Young\u2019s perspective on this, especially considering the complexities involved in blending traditional finance with decentralized models. His caution regarding government regulations and the control of debt distribution is quite insightful.

This means that a buyback and burn approach might not effectively lead to deflationary pressure. In this context, a buyback and make program seems more viable. Once a liquidity threshold is met, the DAO could repurchase ARB from the open market and funnel it back into the treasury, thereby continuously funding the development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Considering that Arbitrum is in its growth stage, investing resources to attract new users and enhance activity on its blockchains is crucial.</p>\n<p>Another important aspect is decentralisation. While token burning reduces circulating supply, it does not augment the system\u2019s overall value. This could inadvertently centralise power by redistributing current value among a smaller group.

It is far easier for a developer, venture studio, or VC-backed entity to fork and deploy on new chains as opposed to spending 12-18 months focusing on innovation.

Perhaps Arbitrum is well-placed to support a shift within these misaligned incentives to support those exploring the potential of the underlying blockchain/rollup.</p>\n<p>Some further musings on my side: Beyond a traditional incubator model, the opportunity seems to be in supporting these concept/pre-seed/seed stage projects by leveraging the USPs of the DAO. For example, a Web3 incubator could embrace:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open/flexible contribution from Web3-native talent.</li>\n<li>Arbitrum or protocol tokenomics to create longer term synergies.</li>\n<li>Rapid GTM testing via user incentives from the DAO treasury.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This approach would give early-stage projects an edge, and at the same time create early-stage stickiness to the chain through support with human resources and intertwined tokenomics. Perhaps this would lead to an increase in native assets within the Arbitrum ecosystem?</p>\n<p>As a starting point you could audit attempts from other ecosystems (Parachains for example) and understand what did and importantly what didn\u2019t work, align Arbitrum DAO stakeholders and form a strategy for said challenge.</p>", "author": "Ken_x3", "parent_post_title": "Bringing Native Assets to Arbitrum", "parent_post_id": 20298}, {"text": "<p>To align incentives, would some combination of upfront payment plus ARB with some amount of linear vesting be a better way to allocate these grants?</p>", "author": "DisruptionJoe", "parent_post_title": "Bringing Native Assets to Arbitrum", "parent_post_id": 20298}, {"text": "<p>Someone didn\u2019t have time to pick up an airdrop between 23 March 2023 and September?

The success of the projects is dependent on the success of the chain, as it generates traffic, which generates revenue.

I understand your concerns regarding the potential participation limitations on the snapshot during ThankArb Season 0. Here\u2019s a detailed perspective on our rationale:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Embracing New Participants</strong>: We sincerely appreciate newcomers and want to emphasize that our program is explicitly designed to be inclusive. An excellent example of this inclusivity is our Jokerace contests, which have an open submission policy. The top 10 submissions, chosen based on community votes, can receive rewards. This means that new participants and existing ARB holders can actively contribute. Note that only those holding ARB before Aug 15 are on the allowlist to earn rewards.</li>\n<li><strong>Balancing Priorities</strong>: The decision to base rewards on the August 15th snapshot was made to acknowledge and give priority to our loyal ARB holders. This approach enables us to gather valuable insights and data from those already invested in the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Sybil Concerns</strong>: Your concern about potential Sybil methods is valid; we take this seriously. The snapshot method was chosen to balance preventing fraudulent activity and fostering inclusivity. We are committed to transparency and plan to release a comprehensive report after this season concludes. This report will provide an in-depth analysis of the method\u2019s performance and explore alternative ways that may be considered for future seasons.</li>\n<li><strong>Future Opportunities</strong>: It\u2019s important to note that Season 0 is just the beginning of our journey. We are eagerly looking forward to welcoming new participants in the upcoming seasons. Even if you do not qualify for Season 0, acquiring and holding ARB tokens now will make you eligible for rewards in Season 1 and beyond.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your feedback is invaluable as we continually refine and improve our initiatives. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to bring them to our attention. We are fully committed to ensuring fairness and inclusivity in our ecosystem now and in the future.</p>", "author": "prose11", "parent_post_title": "Arbitrum GovMonth Week 1: Your Voice Matters!", "parent_post_id": 16167}, {"text": "<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"ModalQuant\" data-post=\"5\" data-topic=\"16167\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/modalquant/48/3082_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> ModalQuant:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Beyond Season 0, a more balanced incentive structure would encourage people from other ecosystems to come and participate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I really like this idea - it echoes my sense that web3 has not even come close to truly unlocking the potential power of the network.
