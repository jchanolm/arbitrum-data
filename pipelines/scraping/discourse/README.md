# Overview

The `DiscourseScraper` is a Python class designed to scrape and collect data from the Arbitrum Foundation forum, which is hosted on the Discourse platform. This script extends a base `Scraper` class (not provided here) and is tailored to fetch categories, topics, posts, and responses from the specified Discourse forum. It organizes the collected data into a structured format for further analysis or storage.

# How It Works

**1. Initialization:** The scraper is initialized with the base URL of the target Discourse forum.
**2. Fetching Categories:** It first fetches all the forum categories.
**3. Fetching Topics:** For each category, it fetches the topics listed under that category.
**4. Fetching Topic Posts:** For each topic, it then fetches the individual posts within the topic, including any responses to these posts.
**5. Organizing Data:** The fetched data is organized into structured JSON format, including details such as post text, title, author, tags, and URLs.
**6. Extracting Posts and Responses:** The script separately extracts posts and their responses into distinct data structures for easier access.
** 7. Saving Data:** Finally, the structured data and metadata are saved locally.


# Data Collected

The scraper collects and organizes data into two main categories: posts and responses. Below are sample JSON structures for each type of data collected.

## Posts

Each post is collected with the following structure:

```
{
  "text": "This is the content of the post.",
  "title": "Post Title",
  "author": "username",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "category": "Category Name",
  "topic_id": 123,
  "url": "https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/123/1"
}
```

## Responses

Each response to a post is collected with the following structure:

```
{
  "text": "This is a response to the above post.",
  "author": "responder_username",
  "parent_post_title": "Post Title",
  "parent_post_id": 123
}
```

## data.json 

The final data object includes both posts and responses, along with some metadata such as the last post number (used to link replies to posts)

```
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "text": "This is the content of the post.",
      "title": "Post Title",
      "author": "username",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
      "category": "Category Name",
      "topic_id": 123,
      "url": "https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/123/1"
    }
  ],
  "responses": [
    {
      "text": "This is a response to the above post.",
      "author": "responder_username",
      "parent_post_title": "Post Title",
      "parent_post_id": 123
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "last_post_number": 123
  }
}
```

The script includes a respectful pause between requests to avoid overloading the forum's servers. Adjust the timing or add additional error handling as necessary.
